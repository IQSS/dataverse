Dataverse&#174;  
===============

Dataverse is an [open source][] software platform for sharing, finding, citing, and preserving research data (developed by the [Dataverse team](https://dataverse.org/about) at the [Institute for Quantitative Social Science](https://iq.harvard.edu/) and the [Dataverse community][]).

[dataverse.org][] is our home on the web and shows a map of Dataverse installations around the world, a list of [features][], [integrations][] that have been made possible through [REST APIs][], our development [roadmap][], and more.

We maintain a demo site at [demo.dataverse.org][] which you are welcome to use for testing and evaluating Dataverse.

To install Dataverse, please see our [Installation Guide][] which will prompt you to download our [latest release][].

To discuss Dataverse with the community, please join our [mailing list][], participate in a [community call][], chat with us at [chat.dataverse.org][], or attend our annual [Dataverse Community Meeting][].

We love contributors! Please see our [Contributing Guide][] for ways you can help.
