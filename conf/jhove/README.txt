These files, jhove.conf and jhoveConfig.xsd should be placed into the <GLASSFISH DOMAIN>/config directoy. 
jhove.conf has the path to the schema file above in it, which should be adjusted, if it's not the default 
/usr/local/glassfish4/glassfish/domains/domain1/conf.
(this should be done by the installer script)
