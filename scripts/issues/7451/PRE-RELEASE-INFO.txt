In the next release another constraint is being added to existing
databases, to prevent any possibility of creating datafile objects
referencing the same file. This was originally planned for v4.20, but
in that release the constraint was only added to newly created
databases, and was not forced on the databases that had already
existed. If your current database was originally created by version
4.20 or newer, you don't need to do anything.

If you do have an older database, it MUST BE RE-CHECKED for any
existing duplicates before the next release (5.6, presumably) can be
deployed. Hopefully there are no such inconsistencies in your
database, but if there are any, they will need to be resolved, or the
next version of the application WILL FAIL TO DEPLOY, with an error
message from FlyWay. Please run the following script:

https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/raw/develop/scripts/issues/7451/check_datafiles_7451.sh

The script relies on the PostgreSQL utility psql to access the
database. You will need to edit the credentials at the top of the script
to match your database configuration.

The script will check your database for any duplicated storage
identifiers that would violate the new constraint. 

For harvested files,  it will directly resolve any conflicts.

For local files, rather than attempt to make any changes right away 
(this being an issue of data integrity with a potential to affect your 
users) it will instruct you to send the produced diagnostic 
information to support@dataverse.org so that we can assist you 
in resolving the issues in your database. 

If no inconsistencies are found, the script will report that the database 
is ready to be upgraded to the next release.

(Please note that there's a very good chance that your database does
not have any conflicts of this nature. But we want to do this to be
absolutely sure. We apologize for any inconvenience.)
