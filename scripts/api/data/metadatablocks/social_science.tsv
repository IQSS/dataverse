	universe	Universe	Description of the population covered by the data in the file; the group of people or other elements that are the object of the study and to which the study results refer.

The universe may consist of elements other than persons, such as housing units, court cases, deaths, countries, and so on. In general, it should be possible to tell from the description of the universe whether a given individual or element is a member of the population under study. Also known as the universe of interest, population of interest, and target population.		textbox	14	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE		socialscience
