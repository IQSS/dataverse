	unitOfAnalysis	Unit of Analysis	Basic unit of analysis or observation that this Dataset describes, such as individuals, families/households, groups, institutions/organizations, administrative units, and more. For information about the DDI's controlled vocabulary for this element, please refer to the DDI web page at http://www.ddialliance.org/controlled-vocabularies.		textbox	0		TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE		socialscience
	universe	Universe	Description of the population covered by the data in the file; the group of people or other elements that are the object of the study and to which the study results refer. Age, nationality, and residence commonly help to  delineate a given universe, but any number of other factors may be used, such as age limits, sex, marital status, race, ethnic group, nationality, income, veteran status, criminal convictions, and more. The universe may consist of elements other than persons, such as housing units, court cases, deaths, countries, and so on. In general, it should be possible to tell from the description of the universe whether a given individual or element is a member of the population under study. Also known as the universe of interest, population of interest, and target population.		textbox	1		TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE		socialscience
