**Data Citation in Dataverse**

|image1|

Dataverse standardizes the citation of datasets to make it easier for researchers to publish their data and get credit for their work.
When you create a dataset in Dataverse, the citation is generated and presented
automatically. As an open source framework and research data
repository, Dataverse is committed to helping researchers, journals,
and organizations make scientific data accessible, reusable, and open
(when possible), which includes implementing community accepted
standards for data publication. For nearly 20 years, members of `IQSS <http://www.iq.harvard.edu/>`_ and its `Data Science <http://datascience.iq.harvard.edu/>`_
team, who work on Dataverse, have played an active part in the
the work to standardize data citation (King
1995, Altman & King 2007, Altman & Crosas 2013). 
Mercè Crosas, Director of Data Science at IQSS has been directly
involved in the `Data Citation Synthesis Group <https://www.force11.org/node/4785>`_, which recently
published the `Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles (2014) <https://www.force11.org/datacitation>`_: a 
synthesis of all previously existing principles and initiatives on
data citation. Illustrated in the figure below, is an example of how
the data citation is formulated in Dataverse, using the principles,
when generating data citations for datasets.
