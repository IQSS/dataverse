**Introduction**


**Enforce SSL on SWORD**

- Set up connector Apache and Glassfish
``asadmin create-network-listener --protocol http-listener-1 --listenerport 8009 --jkenabled true jk-connector``

- Apache dataverse.conf

Add the following to ``/etc/httpd/conf.d/dataverse.conf``

.. code-block:: guess

  # From https://wiki.apache.org/httpd/RewriteHTTPToHTTPS
  RewriteEngine On
 
  # This will enable the Rewrite capabilities
  RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on
 
  # This checks to make sure the connection is not already HTTPS
  # RewriteRule ^/?(.*) https://%{SERVER_NAME}/$1 [R,L] 
  RewriteRule ^/dvn/api/data-deposit/?(.*) https://%{SERVER_NAME}/dvn/api/data-deposit/$1 [R,L]
  # This rule will redirect users from their original location, to the same location but using HTTPS.
  # i.e.  http://www.example.com/foo/ to https://www.example.com/foo/
  # The leading slash is made optional so that this will work either in httpd.conf or .htaccess context
