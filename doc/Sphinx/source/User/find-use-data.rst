Finding and Using Data
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Finding Data
=============

Without logging in to Dataverse, users can browse
Dataverse, search for dataverses, datasets, and files, view dataset descriptions and files for
public datasets, and subset, analyze and visualize data for public data
files. To view a restricted dataverse, dataset, or file, a user will need to be given permission from that dataverse's adminstrator to access it. 

A user can search the dataverses, datasets, and files within a particular dataverse by using the search bar found on a dataverse page. For example, if you are on the Murray Research Archive Dataverse page, you can search that specific dataverse's contents by using the search bar and/or facets displayed on the page.

Basic Search
--------------
From the Dataverse homepage, you can begin searching with an exact phrase search or entering a search term or query in the search box that says, "Search this dataverse" 

**Search results features**

- Facets: to the left of the search results, there are several facets a user can click on to narrow the number of results displayed. 
    - Choosing a facet: to choose a facet, click on the facet to choose it
    - Removing a facet: to remove a facet, click on the X next to a chosen facet in search string above the results OR a chosen facet can be removed by clicking on the X next to it in the facets pane to the left of the results
    - Viewing more or less: the top five results show in each facet, to view more, click on "More..." in the bottom right of a facet. Once you've chosen to see more, an option to view less will appear in the bottom left of the facet.
   
- Result cards: after entering a search term or query, results cards that match appear underneath the search bar and to the right of the facets.
    - Relevancy of results: each results card shows which metadata fields match the search query or term you entered into the search bar with the matching term or query bolded. If the search term or query was found in the title or name of the dataverse, dataset, or file, the search term or query will be bolded within it.

- Other basic search features: 
    - Sorting results: search results can be sorted by name (A-Z or Z-A), newest or oldest, or relevancy of results. The sort button can be found above the search results, in the top right.
    - Bookmarkable URLs: search URLs can be copied and sent to a fellow researcher or can be bookmarked for you to be able to return to at a later time.


Advanced Search 
-----------------

In an advanced search, you can refine your criteria by choosing which
Metadata fields to search. You can perform an advanced search on Citation metadata fields as well as domain specific metadata fields (Social Sciences & Humanities, Astronomy & Astrophysics, and Biomedical). Additionally, you can perform an advanced search for dataverses and files.

To perform an advanced search, click the Advanced Search link next to the search bar. 

**Advanced Search fields** 

*Dataverses:*

- Production Date - Date when the data collection/other material(s) were produced (not distributed, released or archived).

*Social Science and Humanities Metadata:*

- Topic Classification - The classification field indicates the broad important topic(s) and subjects that the data cover. Library of Congress subject terms may be used here.  
- Time Period Covered (Start) - Time period to which the data refer. This item reflects the time period covered by the data, not the dates of  coding or making documents machine-readable or the dates the data were collected. Also known as span. The ISO standard for dates (YYYY-MM-DD) is recommended.
- Time Period Covered (End) - Time period to which the data refer. This item reflects the time period covered by the data, not the dates of coding or making documents machine-readable or the dates the data were collected. Also known as span. The ISO standard for dates (YYYY-MM-DD) is recommended.
- Country/Nation - Country were the data was collected. If more than one, they can be separated by commas.
- Geographic Coverage - Information on the geographic coverage of the data. Inclusion of this element in the codebook is recommended.
- Geographic Unit - Information on the geographic coverage of the data. Inclusion of this element in the codebook is recommended.
- Universe - Description of the population covered by the data in the file; the group of people or other elements that are the object of the study and to which the study results refer. Age, nationality, and residence commonly help to  delineate a given universe, but any number of other factors may be used, such as age limits, sex, marital status, race, ethnic group, nationality, income, veteran status, criminal convictions, and more. The universe may consist of elements other than persons, such as housing units, court cases, deaths, countries, and so on. In general, it should be possible to tell from the description of the universe whether a given individual or element is a member of the population under study. Also known as the universe of interest, population of interest, and target population.
- Kind of Data - Type of data included in the file: survey data, census/enumeration data, aggregate data, clinical data, event/transaction data, program source code, machine-readable text, administrative records data, experimental data, psychological test, textual data, coded textual, coded documents, time budget diaries, observation data/ratings, process-produced data, or other.

- Type - The nature or genre of the content of the files in the dataset.
- Facility - The observatory or facility where the data was obtained. 
- Instrument - The instrument used to collect the data.
- Resolution Spatial Resolution - The spatial (angular) resolution that is typical of the observations, in decimal degrees.
- Resolution Spectral Resolution - The spectral resolution that is typical of the observations, given as the ratio λ/Δλ.
- Coverage Bandpass - Conventional bandpass name
- Coverage Central Wavelength (m) - The central wavelength of the spectral bandpass, in meters.
- Coverage Minimum Wavelength (m) - The minimum wavelength of the spectral bandpass, in meters.

- Name - Full name by which the file is known.
- Description - A summary describing the file, variables, or type.
- File Type - The extension for the file, for example, JPEG, PNG, dta, etc

Browsing Dataverse
--------------------

In Dataverse, browsing happens when a user hasn't entered a search term or query into the basic search bar. Browsing is the default for a user when they are on the Dataverse homepage or a specific dataverse's page. When browsing, only dataverses and datasets appear in the results list and the results can be sorted by Name (A-Z or Z-A) and by Newest or Oldest.

Additionally, a user can browse all dataverses by clicking on the triangle to the right of a dataverse's name in the breadcrumbs. A drop down menu will appear that holds a listing of all the dataverses within that dataverse. You can click the triangles next to a dataverse's name to view more dataverses within that dataverse. As you continue to browse dataverses, they will appear in the breadcrumbs.

The dataverse breadcrumbs appear on each dataverse page and can be used to navigate throughout Dataverse.


Using Data
===========

View Dataverses & Datasets
-------------

After performing a search and finding the dataverse or dataset you are looking for, click on the name of the dataverse or dataset or on the thumbnail image to be taken to the page for that dataverse or dataset. Once on a dataverse page, you can view the dataverses, datasets, and files within that dataverse.

Once on a dataset page, you will see the title, citation, description, and several other fields as well as a button to email the dataset contact. Below that information, the files, metadata, and version information for the dataset are available. 

Download Files
--------------

Within the Files tab on a dataset page, a user can either Explore the file using SolaFide or Download the file as tab-delimited, RData, Saved Original, or the variable metadata.
