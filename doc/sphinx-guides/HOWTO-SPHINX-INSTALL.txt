This is how to install sphinx: 

On a Mac: 

Download the sphinx zip file; I got mine from here: 
http://sphinx-doc.org/install.html

Unzip it somewhere. In the unzipped directory, do the following as
root, (sudo -i):

python setup.py build
python setup.py install

Another option (Mac/Unix/Windows): Use pip
* Unless you already have it, install pip (https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html)
* run
    pip install sphinx



This is all you need. You should now be able to build HTML/pdf documentation from git sources locally. 

If you need more information on sphinx (probably not), for ex., on how to start a new
documentation project of your own, etc., here's a good link:

As always, Google is your friend. 

For a super useful quick start doc on how to format your source
documents in sphinx, remember to consult Eleni's ".rst cheat sheet":
