This is how to install sphinx: 

On a Mac: 

Download the sphinx zip file; I got mine from here: 
http://sphinx-doc.org/install.html

Unzip it somewhere. In the unzipped directory, do the following as
root, (sudo -i):

python setup.py build
python setup.py install

This is all you need. You should now be able to build HTML/pdf documentation from git sources locally. 

If you need more information on sphinx (probably not), for ex., on how to start a new
documentation project of your own, etc., here's a good link:

http://pythonhosted.org/an_example_pypi_project/sphinx.html

As always, Google is your friend. 

For a super useful quick start doc on how to format your source
documents in sphinx, remember to consult Eleni's ".rst cheat sheet":
