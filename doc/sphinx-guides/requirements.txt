# Developers, please use Python 3.9 or lower to build the guides.
# For your convenience, a solution for Python 3.10 is provided below
# but we would prefer that you use the same version of Sphinx
# (below on the < 3.10 line) that is used to build the production guides.
Sphinx==3.5.4 ; python_version < '3.10'
Sphinx==5.3.0 ; python_version >= '3.10'
