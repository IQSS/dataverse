Admin Guide
===========

This guide documents the functionality only available to the Dataverse Admin ("Network Administrator") users. As of this release (4.5) such functionality includes managing Harvesting (client and server) and batch metadata export. 

These "superuser" tasks are managed via the new page called the Dashboard. A user logged in as a Dataverse Admin will see the Dashboard link rendered in the upper right corner of every Dataverse page.
