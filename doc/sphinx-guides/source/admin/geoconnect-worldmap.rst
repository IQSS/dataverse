Geoconnect and WorldMap
=======================

.. contents:: :local:

One of the optional components listed under "Architecture and Components" in the :doc:`/installation/prep` section of the Installation Guide is `Geoconnect <https://github.com/IQSS/geoconnect>`_, a piece of middleware that allows Dataverse users to create maps in `WorldMap <http://worldmap.harvard.edu>`_ based on geospatial data stored in Dataverse. For more details on the feature from the user perspective, see the :doc:`/user/data-exploration/worldmap` section of the User Guide.

Update "mapitlink"
------------------

SQL commands to point a Dataverse installation at different Geoconnect servers:


**Geoconnect Production** *geoconnect.datascience.iq.harvard.edu*

.. code-block:: sql

    update worldmapauth_tokentype set mapitlink = 'https://geoconnect.datascience.iq.harvard.edu/shapefile/map-it', hostname='geoconnect.datascience.iq.harvard.edu' where name = 'GEOCONNECT';

**Heroku Test** *geoconnect-dev.herokuapp.com*

.. code-block:: sql

    update worldmapauth_tokentype set mapitlink = 'https://geoconnect-dev.herokuapp.com/shapefile/map-it', hostname='geoconnect-dev.herokuapp.com' where name = 'GEOCONNECT';


**View Current Settings**

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT * from worldmapauth_tokentype;


Removing Dead Explore Links
---------------------------

After a map has been created in WorldMap (assuming all the setup has been done), an "Explore" button will appear next to the name of the file in Dataverse. The "Explore" button should open the map in WorldMap. In rare occasions, the map has been deleted on the WorldMap side such that the "Explore" button goes nowhere, resulting in a dead link, a 404.

Functionality has been added on the Dataverse side to iterate through all the maps Dataverse knows about (stored in the ``maplayermetadata`` database table) and to check for the existence of each map in WorldMap. The status code returned from WorldMap (200, 404, etc.) is recorded in Dataverse along with a timestamp of when the check was performed. To perform this check, you can execute the following ``curl`` command:

``curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/admin/geoconnect/mapLayerMetadatas/check``

The output above will contain the ``layerLink`` being checked as well as the HTTP response status code (200, 404, etc.) in the ``lastVerifiedStatus`` field. 200 means OK and 404 means not found. 500 might indicate that the map is only temporarily unavailable. The ``lastVerifiedStatus`` and ``lastVerifiedTime`` will be persisted to the ``maplayermetadata`` database table.

Armed with this information about WorldMap returning a 404 for a map, you may want to delete any record of the map on the Dataverse side so that the "Explore" button goes away (and so that thumbnail files are cleaned up). To accomplish this, use the following ``curl`` command, substituting the id of the file:

``curl -H "X-Dataverse-key: $API_TOKEN" -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/files/{file_id}/map``

End users can also run the ``DELETE`` command above (if they have permission to edit the dataset) but it's more likely that the sysadmin reading this guide will run it for them. It is recommended that you add the "check" command above to cron so that Dataverse periodically checks on the status of maps in WorldMap. In addition to the "check all maps" command above, you can also check an individual map with the following ``curl`` command, substituting the id of the row from the ``maplayermetadata`` table:

``curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/admin/geoconnect/mapLayerMetadatas/check/{id}``
