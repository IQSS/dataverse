Metadata Customization
======================

The Dataverse Software has a flexible data-driven metadata system powered by "metadata blocks" that are listed in the :doc:`/user/appendix` section of the User Guide. In this section we explain the customization options.

Introduction
------------

Before you embark on customizing metadata in your Dataverse installation you should make sure you are aware of the modest amount of customization that is available with your Dataverse installation's web interface. It's possible to hide fields and make fields required or conditionally required by clicking "Edit" at the Dataverse collection level, clicking "General Information" and making adjustments under "Metadata Fields" as described in the :ref:`create-dataverse` section of the Dataverse Collection Management page in the User Guide.

Much more customization of metadata is possible, but this is an advanced topic so feedback on what is written below is very welcome. The possibilities for customization include:

-  Editing and adding metadata fields

-  Editing and adding instructional text (field label tooltips and text box watermarks)

-  Editing and adding controlled vocabularies

-  Changing which fields depositors must use in order to save datasets (see also :ref:`dataset-templates` section of the User Guide.)

-  Changing how saved metadata values are displayed in the UI

Generally speaking it is safer to create your own custom metadata block rather than editing metadata blocks that ship with the Dataverse Software, because changes to these blocks may be made in future releases. If you'd like to make improvements to any of the metadata blocks shipped with the  Dataverse Software, please open an issue at https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues so it can be discussed before a pull request is made. Please note that the metadata blocks shipped with the Dataverse Software are based on standards (e.g. DDI for social science) and you can learn more about these standards in the :doc:`/user/appendix` section of the User Guide. If you have developed your own custom metadata block that you think may be of interest to the Dataverse community, please create an issue and consider making a pull request as described in the :doc:`/developers/version-control` section of the Developer Guide.

In current versions of the Dataverse Software, custom metadata are no longer defined as individual
fields, as they were in Dataverse Network (DVN) 3.x, but in metadata blocks.
The Dataverse Software now ships with a citation metadata block, which includes
mandatory fields needed for assigning persistent IDs to datasets, and
domain specific metadata blocks. For a complete list, see the
:doc:`/user/appendix` section of the User Guide.

Definitions of these blocks are loaded into a Dataverse installation in
tab-separated value (TSV). [1]_\ :sup:`,`\  [2]_ While it is technically
possible to define more than one metadata block in a TSV file, it is
good organizational practice to define only one in each file.

The metadata block TSVs shipped with the Dataverse Software are in `/tree/develop/scripts/api/data/metadatablocks
<https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/tree/develop/scripts/api/data/metadatablocks>`__ and the corresponding ResourceBundle property files `/tree/develop/src/main/java <https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/tree/develop/src/main/java>`__ of the Dataverse Software GitHub repo. Human-readable copies are available in `this Google Sheets
document <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13HP-jI_cwLDHBetn9UKTREPJ_F4iHdAvhjmlvmYdSSw/edit#gid=0>`__ but they tend to get out of sync with the TSV files, which should be considered authoritative. The Dataverse Software installation process operates on the TSVs, not the Google spreadsheet.

About the metadata block TSV
----------------------------

Here we list and describe the purposes of each section and property of
the metadata block TSV.

1. metadataBlock

   -  Purpose: Represents the metadata block being defined.

   -  Cardinality:

      -  0 or more per Dataverse installation

      -  1 per Metadata Block definition

2. datasetField

   -  Purpose: Each entry represents a metadata field to be defined
      within a metadata block.

   -  Cardinality: 1 or more per metadataBlock

3. controlledVocabulary

   -  Purpose: Each entry enumerates an allowed value for a given
      datasetField.

   -  Cardinality: zero or more per datasetField

Each of the three main sections own sets of properties:

Metadata Block Setup
--------------------

Now that you understand the TSV format used for metadata blocks, the next step is to attempt to make improvements to existing metadata blocks or create entirely new metadata blocks. For either task, you should have a Dataverse Software development environment set up for testing where you can drop the database frequently while you make edits to TSV files. Once you have tested your TSV files, you should consider making a pull request to contribute your improvement back to the community.

Exploring Metadata Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to studying the TSV files themselves you might find the following highly experimental and subject-to-change API endpoints useful to understand the metadata blocks that have already been loaded into your Dataverse installation:

You can get a dump of metadata fields (yes, the output is odd, please open a issue) like this:

``curl http://localhost:8080/api/admin/datasetfield``

To see details about an individual field such as "title" in the example below:

``curl http://localhost:8080/api/admin/datasetfield/title``

Setting Up a Dev Environment for Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You have several options for setting up a dev environment for testing metadata block changes:

- Vagrant: See the :doc:`/developers/tools` section of the Developer Guide.
- docker-aio: See https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/tree/develop/conf/docker-aio
- AWS deployment: See the :doc:`/developers/deployment` section of the Developer Guide.
- Full dev environment: See the :doc:`/developers/dev-environment` section of the Developer Guide.

To get a clean environment in Vagrant, you'll be running ``vagrant destroy``. In Docker, you'll use ``docker rm``. For a full dev environment or AWS installation, you might find ``rebuild`` and related scripts at ``scripts/deploy/phoenix.dataverse.org`` useful.

Editing TSV files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Early in Dataverse Software 4.0 development, metadata blocks were edited in the Google spreadsheet mentioned above and then exported in TSV format. This worked fine when there was only one person editing the Google spreadsheet but now that contributions are coming in from all over, the TSV files are edited directly. We are somewhat painfully aware that another format such as XML might make more sense these days. Please see https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/4451 for a discussion of non-TSV formats.

Please note that metadata fields share a common namespace so they must be unique. The following curl command will print the list of metadata fields already available in the system:

``curl http://localhost:8080/api/admin/index/solr/schema``

We'll use this command again below to update the Solr schema to accomodate metadata fields we've added.

Loading TSV files into a Dataverse Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A number of TSV files are loaded into a newly-installed Dataverse installation, becoming the metadata blocks you see in the UI. For the list of metadata blocks that are included with the Dataverse Software out of the box, see the :doc:`/user/appendix` section of the User Guide.

Along with TSV file, there are corresponding ResourceBundle property files with key=value pair `here <https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/tree/develop/src/main/java/propertyFiles>`__.  To add other language files, see the :doc:`/installation/config` for dataverse.lang.directory JVM Options section, and add a file, for example: "citation_lang.properties" to the path you specified for the ``dataverse.lang.directory`` JVM option, and then restart the app server.

If you are improving an existing metadata block, the Dataverse Software installation process will load the TSV for you, assuming you edited the TSV file in place. The TSV file for the Citation metadata block, for example, can be found at ``scripts/api/data/metadatablocks/citation.tsv``.
If any of the below mentioned property values are changed, corresponding ResourceBundle property file has to be edited and stored under ``dataverse.lang.directory`` location

- name, displayName property under #metadataBlock
- name, title, description, watermark properties under #datasetfield
- DatasetField, Value property under #controlledVocabulary

If you are creating a new custom metadata block (hopefully with the idea of contributing it back to the community if you feel like it would provide value to others), the Dataverse Software installation process won't know about your new TSV file so you must load it manually. The script that loads the TSV files into the system is ``scripts/api/setup-datasetfields.sh`` and contains a series of curl commands. Here's an example of the necessary curl command with the new custom metadata block in the "/tmp" directory.

``curl http://localhost:8080/api/admin/datasetfield/load -H "Content-type: text/tab-separated-values" -X POST --upload-file /tmp/new-metadata-block.tsv``

To create a new ResourceBundle, here are the steps to generate key=value pair for the three main sections:

#metadataBlock properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
metadatablock.name=(the value of **name** property from #metadatablock)

metadatablock.displayName=(the value of **displayName** property from #metadatablock)

example:

metadatablock.name=citation

metadatablock.displayName=Citation Metadata

#datasetField (field) properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
datasetfieldtype.(the value of **name** property from #datasetField).title=(the value of **title** property from #datasetField)

datasetfieldtype.(the value of **name** property from #datasetField).description=(the value of **description** property from #datasetField)

datasetfieldtype.(the value of **name** property from #datasetField).watermark=(the value of **watermark** property from #datasetField)

example:

datasetfieldtype.title.title=Title

datasetfieldtype.title.description=Full title by which the Dataset is known.

datasetfieldtype.title.watermark=Enter title...

#controlledVocabulary (enumerated) properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
controlledvocabulary.(the value of **DatasetField** property from #controlledVocabulary).(the value of **Value** property from #controlledVocabulary)=(the value of **Value** property from #controlledVocabulary)

Since the **Value** property from #controlledVocabulary is free text, while creating the key, it has to be converted to lowercase, replace space with underscore, and strip accents.

example:

controlledvocabulary.subject.agricultural_sciences=Agricultural Sciences

controlledvocabulary.language.marathi_(marathi)=Marathi (Mar\u0101\u1E6Dh\u012B)


Enabling a Metadata Block
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Running a curl command like "load" example above should make the new custom metadata block available within the system but in order to start using the fields you must either enable it from the UI (see :ref:`general-information` section of Dataverse Collection Management in the User Guide) or by running a curl command like the one below using a superuser API token. In the example below we are enabling the "journal" and "geospatial" metadata blocks for the root Dataverse collection:

``curl -H "X-Dataverse-key:$API_TOKEN" -X POST -H "Content-type:application/json" -d "[\"journal\",\"geospatial\"]" http://localhost:8080/api/dataverses/:root/metadatablocks``

Updating the Solr Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have enabled a new metadata block you should be able to see the new fields in the GUI but before you can save
the dataset, you must add additional fields to your Solr schema.

An API endpoint of your Dataverse installation provides you with a generated set of all fields that need to be added to
the Solr schema configuration, including any enabled metadata schemas:

``curl "http://localhost:8080/api/admin/index/solr/schema"``

You can use :download:`update-fields.sh <../../../../conf/solr/8.11.1/update-fields.sh>` to easily add these to the
Solr schema you installed for your Dataverse installation.

The script needs a target XML file containing your Solr schema. (See the :doc:`/installation/prerequisites/` section of
the Installation Guide for a suggested location on disk for the Solr schema file.)

You can either pipe the downloaded schema to the script or provide the file as an argument. (We recommended you to take
a look at usage output of ``update-fields.sh -h``)

.. code-block::
    :caption: Example usage of ``update-fields.sh``

    curl "http://localhost:8080/api/admin/index/solr/schema" | update-fields.sh /usr/local/solr/server/solr/collection1/conf/schema.xml

You will need to reload your Solr schema via an HTTP-API call, targeting your Solr instance:

``curl "http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/cores?action=RELOAD&core=collection1"``

You can easily roll your own little script to automate the process (which might involve fetching the schema bits
from some place else than your Dataverse installation).

Please note that reconfigurations of your Solr index might require a re-index. Usually release notes indicate
a necessary re-index, but for your custom metadata you will need to keep track on your own.

Please note also that if you are going to make a pull request updating ``conf/solr/8.11.1/schema.xml`` with fields you have
added, you should first load all the custom metadata blocks in ``scripts/api/data/metadatablocks`` (including ones you
don't care about) to create a complete list of fields. (This might change in the future.)

Reloading a Metadata Block
--------------------------

As mentioned above, changes to metadata blocks that ship with the Dataverse Software will be made over time to improve them and release notes will sometimes instruct you to reload an existing metadata block. The syntax for reloading is the same as loading. Here's an example with the "citation" metadata block:

``curl http://localhost:8080/api/admin/datasetfield/load -H "Content-type: text/tab-separated-values" -X POST --upload-file citation.tsv``

Great care must be taken when reloading a metadata block. Matching is done on field names (or identifiers and then names in the case of controlled vocabulary values) so it's easy to accidentally create duplicate fields.

The ability to reload metadata blocks means that SQL update scripts don't need to be written for these changes. See also the :doc:`/developers/sql-upgrade-scripts` section of the Developer Guide.

Using External Vocabulary Services
----------------------------------

The Dataverse software has a mechanism to associate specific fields defined in metadata blocks with a vocabulary(ies) managed by external services. The mechanism relies on trusted third-party Javascripts. The mapping from field type to external vocabulary(ies) is managed via the :ref:`:CVocConf <:CVocConf>` setting.

*This functionality is considered 'experimental'. It may require significant effort to configure and is likely to evolve in subsequent Dataverse software releases.*


The effect of configuring this mechanism is similar to that of defining a field in a metadata block with 'allowControlledVocabulary=true':

- Users are able to select from a controlled list of values.
- Values can be shown in any language the term has been defined in.
  
In general, the external vocabulary support mechanism may be a better choice for large vocabularies, hierarchical/structured vocabularies, and/or vocabularies managed by third-parties. In addition, the external vocabulary mechanism differs from the internal controlled vocabulary mechanism in several ways that may make it a preferred option:

- the machine-readable URI form of a vocabulary is stored in the Dataverse database and can be included in exported metadata files.
- vocabulary mappings can be changed without changing the metadata block, making it possible for different Dataverse installations to use different vocabularies in the same field.
- mappings can associate a field with more than one vocabulary.
- mappings can be configured to also allow custom/free-text entries as well as vocabulary values.
- mappings can be configured for compound fields and a user's selection of a given vocabulary value can be used to fill in related child fields (e.g. selection of a keyword could fill in a vocabulary name field as well).
- removing a mapping does not affect stored values (the field would revert to allowing free text).
 
The specifics of the user interface for entering/selecting a vocabulary term and how that term is then displayed are managed by third-party Javascripts. The initial Javascripts that have been created provide auto-completion, displaying a list of choices that match what the user has typed so far, but other interfaces, such as displaying a tree of options for a hierarchical vocabulary, are possible. 
Similarly, existing scripts do relatively simple things for displaying a term - showing the term's name in the appropriate language and providing a link to an external URL with more information, but more sophisticated displays are possible.

Scripts supporting use of vocabularies from services supporting the SKOMOS protocol (see https://skosmos.org) and retrieving ORCIDs (from https:/orcid.org) are available https://github.com/gdcc/dataverse-external-vocab-support. (Custom scripts can also be used and community members are encouraged to share new scripts through the dataverse-external-vocab-support repository.)

Configuration involves specifying which fields are to be mapped, whether free-text entries are allowed, which vocabulary(ies) should be used, what languages those vocabulary(ies) are available in, and several service protocol and service instance specific parameters.
These are all defined in the :ref:`:CVocConf <:CVocConf>` setting as a JSON array. Details about the required elements as well as example JSON arrays are available at https://github.com/gdcc/dataverse-external-vocab-support, along with an example metadata block that can be used for testing.
The scripts required can be hosted locally or retrieved dynamically from https://gdcc.github.io/ (similar to how dataverse-previewers work).

Please note that in addition to the :ref:`:CVocConf` described above, an alternative is the :ref:`:ControlledVocabularyCustomJavaScript` setting.

Tips from the Dataverse Community
---------------------------------

When creating new metadata blocks, please review the :doc:`/style/text` section of the Style Guide, which includes guidance about naming metadata fields and writing text for metadata tooltips and watermarks.

If there are tips that you feel are omitted from this document, please open an issue at https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues and consider making a pull request to make improvements. You can find this document at https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/blob/develop/doc/sphinx-guides/source/admin/metadatacustomization.rst

Alternatively, you are welcome to request "edit" access to this "Tips for Dataverse Software metadata blocks from the community" Google doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XpblRw0v0SvV-Bq6njlN96WyHJ7tqG0WWejqBdl7hE0/edit?usp=sharing

The thinking is that the tips can become issues and the issues can eventually be worked on as features to improve the Dataverse Software metadata system.
