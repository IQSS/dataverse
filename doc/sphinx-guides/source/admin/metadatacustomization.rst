Metadata Customization
======================

The Dataverse Software has a flexible data-driven metadata system powered by "metadata blocks" that are listed in the :doc:`/user/appendix` section of the User Guide. In this section we explain the customization options.

Introduction
------------

Before you embark on customizing metadata in your Dataverse installation you should make sure you are aware of the modest amount of customization that is available with your Dataverse installation's web interface. It's possible to hide fields and make fields required or conditionally required by clicking "Edit" at the Dataverse collection level, clicking "General Information" and making adjustments under "Metadata Fields" as described in the :ref:`create-dataverse` section of the Dataverse Collection Management page in the User Guide.

Much more customization of metadata is possible, but this is an advanced topic so feedback on what is written below is very welcome. The possibilities for customization include:

-  Editing and adding metadata fields

-  Editing and adding instructional text (field label tooltips and text box watermarks)

-  Editing and adding controlled vocabularies

-  Changing which fields depositors must use in order to save datasets (see also :ref:`dataset-templates` section of the User Guide.)

-  Changing how saved metadata values are displayed in the UI

Generally speaking it is safer to create your own custom metadata block rather than editing metadata blocks that ship with the Dataverse Software, because changes to these blocks may be made in future releases. If you'd like to make improvements to any of the metadata blocks shipped with the  Dataverse Software, please open an issue at https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues so it can be discussed before a pull request is made. Please note that the metadata blocks shipped with the Dataverse Software are based on standards (e.g. DDI for social science) and you can learn more about these standards in the :doc:`/user/appendix` section of the User Guide. If you have developed your own custom metadata block that you think may be of interest to the Dataverse community, please create an issue and consider making a pull request as described in the :doc:`/developers/version-control` section of the Developer Guide.

In current versions of the Dataverse Software, custom metadata are no longer defined as individual
fields, as they were in Dataverse Network (DVN) 3.x, but in metadata blocks.
The Dataverse Software now ships with a citation metadata block, which includes
mandatory fields needed for assigning persistent IDs to datasets, and
domain specific metadata blocks. For a complete list, see the
:doc:`/user/appendix` section of the User Guide.

Definitions of these blocks are loaded into a Dataverse installation in
tab-separated value (TSV). [1]_\ :sup:`,`\  [2]_ While it is technically
possible to define more than one metadata block in a TSV file, it is
good organizational practice to define only one in each file.

The metadata block TSVs shipped with the Dataverse Software are in `/tree/develop/scripts/api/data/metadatablocks
<https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/tree/develop/scripts/api/data/metadatablocks>`__ and the corresponding ResourceBundle property files `/tree/develop/src/main/java <https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/tree/develop/src/main/java>`__ of the Dataverse Software GitHub repo. Human-readable copies are available in `this Google Sheets
document <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13HP-jI_cwLDHBetn9UKTREPJ_F4iHdAvhjmlvmYdSSw/edit#gid=0>`__ but they tend to get out of sync with the TSV files, which should be considered authoritative. The Dataverse Software installation process operates on the TSVs, not the Google spreadsheet.

About the metadata block TSV
----------------------------

Here we list and describe the purposes of each section and property of
the metadata block TSV.

1. metadataBlock

   -  Purpose: Represents the metadata block being defined.

   -  Cardinality:

      -  0 or more per Dataverse installation

      -  1 per Metadata Block definition

2. datasetField

   -  Purpose: Each entry represents a metadata field to be defined
      within a metadata block.

   -  Cardinality: 1 or more per metadataBlock

3. controlledVocabulary

   -  Purpose: Each entry enumerates an allowed value for a given
      datasetField.

   -  Cardinality: zero or more per datasetField

Each of the three main sections own sets of properties:

displayFormat variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are common ways to use the displayFormat to control how values are displayed in the UI. This list is not exhaustive.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **Variable**                      | **Description**                   |

|                                   | for primitive fields (e.g.        |
|                                   | subtitle) and fields that do not  |
|                                   | take values (e.g. author), since  |
|                                   | displayFormats do not work for    |
|                                   | these fields.                     |

Metadata Block Setup
--------------------

Now that you understand the TSV format used for metadata blocks, the next step is to attempt to make improvements to existing metadata blocks or create entirely new metadata blocks. For either task, you should have a Dataverse Software development environment set up for testing where you can drop the database frequently while you make edits to TSV files. Once you have tested your TSV files, you should consider making a pull request to contribute your improvement back to the community.

Exploring Metadata Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to studying the TSV files themselves you might find the following highly experimental and subject-to-change API endpoints useful to understand the metadata blocks that have already been loaded into your Dataverse installation:

You can get a dump of metadata fields (yes, the output is odd, please open a issue) like this:

``curl http://localhost:8080/api/admin/datasetfield``

To see details about an individual field such as "title" in the example below:

``curl http://localhost:8080/api/admin/datasetfield/title``

Setting Up a Dev Environment for Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You have several options for setting up a dev environment for testing metadata block changes:

- Vagrant: See the :doc:`/developers/tools` section of the Developer Guide.
- docker-aio: See https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/tree/develop/conf/docker-aio
- AWS deployment: See the :doc:`/developers/deployment` section of the Developer Guide.
- Full dev environment: See the :doc:`/developers/dev-environment` section of the Developer Guide.

To get a clean environment in Vagrant, you'll be running ``vagrant destroy``. In Docker, you'll use ``docker rm``. For a full dev environment or AWS installation, you might find ``rebuild`` and related scripts at ``scripts/deploy/phoenix.dataverse.org`` useful.

Editing TSV files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Early in Dataverse Software 4.0 development, metadata blocks were edited in the Google spreadsheet mentioned above and then exported in TSV format. This worked fine when there was only one person editing the Google spreadsheet but now that contributions are coming in from all over, the TSV files are edited directly. We are somewhat painfully aware that another format such as XML might make more sense these days. Please see https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/4451 for a discussion of non-TSV formats.

Please note that metadata fields share a common namespace so they must be unique. The following curl command will print list of metadata fields already available in the system:

``curl http://localhost:8080/api/admin/index/solr/schema``

We'll use this command again below to update the Solr schema to accomodate metadata fields we've added.

Loading TSV files into a Dataverse Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A number of TSV files are loaded into a newly-installed Dataverse installation, becoming the metadata blocks you see in the UI. For the list of metadata blocks that are included with the Dataverse Software out of the box, see the :doc:`/user/appendix` section of the User Guide.

Along with TSV file, there are corresponding ResourceBundle property files with key=value pair `here <https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/tree/develop/src/main/java>`__.  To add other language files, see the :doc:`/installation/config` for dataverse.lang.directory JVM Options section, and add a file, for example: "citation_lang.properties" to the path you specified for the ``dataverse.lang.directory`` JVM option, and then restart the app server.

If you are improving an existing metadata block, the Dataverse Software installation process will load the TSV for you, assuming you edited the TSV file in place. The TSV file for the Citation metadata block, for example, can be found at ``scripts/api/data/metadatablocks/citation.tsv``.
If any of the below mentioned property values are changed, corresponsing ResourceBundle property file has to be edited and stored under ``dataverse.lang.directory`` location

- name, displayName property under #metadataBlock
- name, title, description, watermark properties under #datasetfield
- DatasetField, Value property under #controlledVocabulary

If you are creating a new custom metadata block (hopefully with the idea of contributing it back to the community if you feel like it would provide value to others), the Dataverse Software installation process won't know about your new TSV file so you must load it manually. The script that loads the TSV files into the system is ``scripts/api/setup-datasetfields.sh`` and contains a series of curl commands. Here's an example of the necessary curl command with the new custom metadata block in the "/tmp" directory.

``curl http://localhost:8080/api/admin/datasetfield/load -H "Content-type: text/tab-separated-values" -X POST --upload-file /tmp/new-metadata-block.tsv``

To create a new ResourceBundle, here are the steps to generate key=value pair for the three main sections:

#metadataBlock properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
metadatablock.name=(the value of **name** property from #metadatablock)

metadatablock.displayName=(the value of **displayName** property from #metadatablock)

example:

metadatablock.name=citation

metadatablock.displayName=Citation Metadata

#datasetField (field) properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
datasetfieldtype.(the value of **name** property from #datasetField).title=(the value of **title** property from #datasetField)

datasetfieldtype.(the value of **name** property from #datasetField).description=(the value of **description** property from #datasetField)

datasetfieldtype.(the value of **name** property from #datasetField).watermark=(the value of **watermark** property from #datasetField)

example:

datasetfieldtype.title.title=Title

datasetfieldtype.title.description=Full title by which the Dataset is known.

datasetfieldtype.title.watermark=Enter title...

#controlledVocabulary (enumerated) properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
controlledvocabulary.(the value of **DatasetField** property from #controlledVocabulary).(the value of **Value** property from #controlledVocabulary)=(the value of **Value** property from #controlledVocabulary)

Since the **Value** property from #controlledVocabulary is free text, while creating the key, it has to be converted to lowercase, replace space with underscore, and strip accents.

example:

controlledvocabulary.subject.agricultural_sciences=Agricultural Sciences

controlledvocabulary.language.marathi_(marathi)=Marathi (Mar\u0101\u1E6Dh\u012B)


Enabling a Metadata Block
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Running a curl command like "load" example above should make the new custom metadata block available within the system but in order to start using the fields you must either enable it from the UI (see :ref:`general-information` section of Dataverse Collection Management in the User Guide) or by running a curl command like the one below using a superuser API token. In the example below we are enabling the "journal" and "geospatial" metadata blocks for the root Dataverse collection:

``curl -H "X-Dataverse-key:$API_TOKEN" -X POST -H "Content-type:application/json" -d "[\"journal\",\"geospatial\"]" http://localhost:8080/api/dataverses/:root/metadatablocks``

Updating the Solr Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have enabled a new metadata block you should be able to see the new fields in the GUI but before you can save
the dataset, you must add additional fields to your Solr schema.

An API endpoint of your Dataverse installation provides you with a generated set of all fields that need to be added to the Solr schema
configuration, including any enabled metadata schemas:

``curl http://localhost:8080/api/admin/index/solr/schema``

For convenience and automation you can download and consider running :download:`updateSchemaMDB.sh <../../../../conf/solr/8.8.1/updateSchemaMDB.sh>`. It uses the API endpoint above and writes schema files to the filesystem (so be sure to run it on the Solr server itself as the Unix user who owns the Solr files) and then triggers a Solr reload.

By default, it will download from your Dataverse installation at `http://localhost:8080` and reload Solr at `http://localhost:8983`.
You may use the following environment variables with this script or mix'n'match with options:

====================  ======  ===============================================  =========================================================
Environment variable  Option  Description                                      Example
====================  ======  ===============================================  =========================================================
`DATAVERSE_URL`       `-d`    Provide the URL to your Dataverse installation   *http://localhost:8080*
`SOLR_URL`            `-s`    Provide the URL to your Solr instance            *http://localhost:8983*
`UNBLOCK_KEY`         `-u`    If your installation has a blocked admin API     *xyz* or */secrets/unblock.key*
                              endpoint, you can provide either the key itself
                              or a path to a keyfile
`TARGET`              `-t`    Provide the config directory of your Solr core   */usr/local/solr/solr-8.8.1/server/solr/collection1/conf*
                              "collection1"

See the :doc:`/installation/prerequisites/` section of the Installation Guide for a suggested location on disk for the Solr schema file.

Please note that if you are going to make a pull request updating ``conf/solr/8.8.1/schema.xml`` with fields you have added, you should first load all the custom metadata blocks in ``scripts/api/data/metadatablocks`` (including ones you don't care about) to create a complete list of fields.

Reloading a Metadata Block
--------------------------

As mentioned above, changes to metadata blocks that ship with the Dataverse Software will be made over time to improve them and release notes will sometimes instruct you to reload an existing metadata block. The syntax for reloading is the same as reloading. Here's an example with the "citation" metadata block:

``curl http://localhost:8080/api/admin/datasetfield/load -H "Content-type: text/tab-separated-values" -X POST --upload-file citation.tsv``

Great care must be taken when reloading a metadata block. Matching is done on field names (or identifiers and then names in the case of controlled vocabulary values) so it's easy to accidentally create duplicate fields.

The ability to reload metadata blocks means that SQL update scripts don't need to be written for these changes. See also the :doc:`/developers/sql-upgrade-scripts` section of the Developer Guide.

Tips from the Dataverse Community
---------------------------------

If there are tips that you feel are omitted from this document, please open an issue at https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues and consider making a pull request to make improvements. You can find this document at https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/blob/develop/doc/sphinx-guides/source/admin/metadatacustomization.rst

Alternatively, you are welcome to request "edit" access to this "Tips for Dataverse Software metadata blocks from the community" Google doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XpblRw0v0SvV-Bq6njlN96WyHJ7tqG0WWejqBdl7hE0/edit?usp=sharing

The thinking is that the tips can become issues and the issues can eventually be worked on as features to improve the Dataverse Software metadata system.

   Although the structure of the data, as you’ll see below, violates the
   “Each record must have the same number of fields” tenet of TSV

   These field names are added to the Solr schema.xml and cannot be
   duplicated. See "Editing TSV files" for how to check for duplication.

   "displayoncreate" was "showabovefold" in Dataverse Software ``<=4.3.1`` (see
   `#3073 <https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/3073>`__) but parsing is
   done based on column order rather than name so this only matters to the
   person reading the TSV file.
