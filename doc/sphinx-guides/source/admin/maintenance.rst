When you have scheduled down time for your production servers, we provide a :download:`sample maintenance page <../_static/installation/files/etc/maintenance/maintenance.xhtml>` for you to use. To download, right-click and select "Save Link As".

The maintenance page is intended to be a static page served by Apache to provide users with a nicer, more informative experience when the site is unavailable.
