Getting Data In
---------------

A variety of integrations are oriented toward making it easier for your researchers to deposit data into your Dataverse installation.

GitHub
++++++

GitHub can be integrated with a Dataverse installation in multiple ways.

One Dataverse integration is implemented via a Dataverse Uploader GitHub Action. It is a reusable, composite workflow for uploading a git repository or subdirectory into a dataset on a target Dataverse installation. The action is customizable, allowing users to choose to replace a dataset, add to the dataset, publish it or leave it as a draft version in the Dataverse installation. The action provides some metadata to the dataset, such as the origin GitHub repository, and it preserves the directory tree structure. 

For instructions on using Dataverse Uploader GitHub Action, visit https://github.com/marketplace/actions/dataverse-uploader-action

In addition to the Dataverse Uploader GitHub Action, the :ref:`integrations-dashboard` also enables a pull of data from GitHub to a dataset.

Dropbox
+++++++

If your researchers have data on Dropbox, you can make it easier for them to get it into your Dataverse installation by setting the :ref:`dataverse.dropbox.key` JVM option described in the :doc:`/installation/config` section of the Installation Guide.

Open Science Framework (OSF)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Center for Open Science's Open Science Framework (OSF) is an open source software project that facilitates open collaboration in science research across the lifespan of a scientific project.

OSF can be integrated with a Dataverse installation in multiple ways.

Researcher can configure OSF itself to deposit to your Dataverse installation by following `instructions from OSF <https://help.osf.io/article/208-connect-dataverse-to-a-project>`_.

In addition to the method mentioned above, the :ref:`integrations-dashboard` also enables a pull of data from OSF to a dataset.

RSpace
++++++

RSpace is an affordable and secure enterprise grade electronic lab notebook (ELN) for researchers to capture and organize data.

For instructions on depositing data from RSpace to your Dataverse installation, your researchers can visit https://www.researchspace.com/help-and-support-resources/dataverse-integration/

Open Journal Systems (OJS)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Open Journal Systems (OJS) is a journal management and publishing system that has been developed by the Public Knowledge Project to expand and improve access to research.

The OJS Dataverse Project Plugin adds data sharing and preservation to the OJS publication process.

As of this writing only OJS 2.x is supported and instructions for getting started can be found at https://github.com/pkp/ojs/tree/ojs-stable-2_4_8/plugins/generic/dataverse

If you are interested in OJS 3.x supporting deposit to Dataverse installations, please leave a comment on https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/1822

Renku
+++++

Renku is a platform that enables collaborative, reproducible and reusable
(data)science. It allows researchers to automatically record the provenance of
their research results and retain links to imported and exported data. Users
can organize their data in "Datasets", which can be exported to a Dataverse installation via
the command-line interface (CLI).

Renku documentation: https://renku-python.readthedocs.io

Flagship deployment of the Renku platform: https://renkulab.io

Renku discourse: https://renku.discourse.group/

Amnesia
+++++++

Amnesia is a flexible data anonymization tool that transforms relational and transactional databases to datasets where formal privacy guarantees hold. Amnesia transforms original data to provide k-anonymity and km-anonymity: the original data are transformed by generalizing (i.e., replacing one value with a more abstract one) or suppressing values to achieve the statistical properties required by the anonymization guarantees. Amnesia employs visualization tools and supportive mechanisms to allow non expert users to anonymize relational and object-relational data.

For instructions on depositing or loading data from Dataverse installations to Amnesia, visit https://amnesia.openaire.eu/about-documentation.html

SampleDB
++++++++

SampleDB is a web-based electronic lab notebook (ELN) with a focus on flexible metadata. SampleDB can export this flexible, process-specific metadata to a new Dataset in a Dataverse installation using the EngMeta Process Metadata block.

For instructions on using the Dataverse export, you can visit https://scientific-it-systems.iffgit.fz-juelich.de/SampleDB/administrator_guide/dataverse_export.html

RedCap
++++++

RedCap is a web-based application to capture data for clinical research and create databases and projects.

The :ref:`integrations-dashboard` enables a pull of data from RedCap to a dataset in Dataverse.

GitLab
++++++

GitLab is an open source Git repository and platform that provides free open and private repositories, issue-following capabilities, and wikis for collaborative software development.

The :ref:`integrations-dashboard` enables a pull of data from GitLab to a dataset in Dataverse.

iRODS
+++++

An open source, metadata driven data management system that is accessible through a host of different clients.

The :ref:`integrations-dashboard` enables a pull of data from iRODS to a dataset in Dataverse.

.. _integrations-dashboard:

Integrations Dashboard
++++++++++++++++++++++

The integrations dashboard is software by the Dataverse community to enable easy data transfer from an existing data management platform to a dataset in a Dataverse collection.

Instead of trying to set up Dataverse plug-ins in existing tools and systems to push data to a Dataverse installation, the dashboard works in reverse by being a portal to pull data from tools such as iRODS and GitHub into a dataset.

Its aim is to make integrations more flexible and less dependent on the cooperation of system to integrate with. You can use it to either create a dataset from scratch and add metadata after files have been transferred, or you can use it to compare what is already in an existing dataset to make updating files in datasets easier.

Its goal is to make the dashboard adjustable for a Dataverse installation's needs and easy to connect other systems to as well.

The integrations dashboard is currently in development. A preview and more information can be found at: `rdm-integration GitHub repository <https://github.com/libis/rdm-integration>`_
