`Whole Tale <https://wholetale.org>`_  enables researchers to analyze data using popular tools including Jupyter and RStudio with the ultimate goal of supporting publishing of reproducible research packages. Users can
`import data from Dataverse
<https://wholetale.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users_guide/manage.html>`_ via identifier (e.g., DOI, URI, etc) or through the External Tools integration.  For installation instructions, see the :doc:`external-tools` section or the `Integration <https://wholetale.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users_guide/integration.html#dataverse-external-tools>`_ section of the Whole Tale User Guide.

Binder
++++++

Researchers can launch Jupyter Notebooks, RStudio, and other computational environments by entering the DOI of a Dataverse dataset on https://mybinder.org

Institutions can self host BinderHub. Dataverse is one of the supported `repository providers <https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/repoproviders.html#supported-repoproviders>`_.

Renku
+++++

Researchers can import Dataverse datasets into their Renku projects via the
command-line interface (CLI) by using the Dataverse DOI. See the `renku Dataset
documentation
<https://renku-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands.html#module-renku.cli.dataset>`_
for details. Currently Dataverse ``>=4.8.x`` is required for the import to work. If you need
support for an earlier version of Dataverse, please get in touch with the Renku team at
`Discourse <https://renku.discourse.group>`_ or `GitHub <https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku>`_.

Future Integrations
-------------------

The `Dataverse roadmap <https://www.iq.harvard.edu/roadmap-dataverse-project>`_ is a good place to see integrations that the core Dataverse team is working on.

The `Community Dev <https://github.com/orgs/IQSS/projects/2#column-5298405>`_ column of our project board is a good way to track integrations that are being worked on by the Dataverse community but many are not listed and if you have an idea for an integration, please ask on the `dataverse-community <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dataverse-community>`_ mailing list if someone is already working on it.

Many integrations take the form of "external tools". See the :doc:`external-tools` section for details. External tool makers should check out the :doc:`/api/external-tools` section of the API Guide.

Please help us keep this page up to date making a pull request! To get started, see the :doc:`/developers/documentation` section of the Developer Guide.
