Troubleshooting
===============

This new (as of v.4.6) section of the Admin guide is for tips on how to diagnose and fix system problems.

Glassfish
---------

``server.log`` is the main place to look when you encounter problems. Hopefully an error message has been logged. If there's a stack trace, it may be of interest to developers, especially they can trace line numbers back to a tagged version.

For debugging purposes, you may find it helpful to increase logging levels as mentioned in the :doc:`/developers/debugging` section of the Developer Guide.

Our guides focus on using the command line to manage Glassfish but you might be interested in an admin GUI at http://localhost:4848


Deployment fails, "EJB Timer Service not available"
---------------------------------------------------

Sometimes the Dataverse application fails to deploy, or Glassfish fails to restart once the application is deployed, with the following error message: :fixedwidthplain:`"remote failure: Error occurred during deployment: Exception while loading the app : EJB Timer Service is not available. Please see server.log for more details."`

We don't know what's causing this issue, but here's a known workaround: 

- Stop Glassfish; 

- Remove the ``generated`` and ``osgi-cache`` directories; 

- Delete all the rows from the ``EJB__TIMER__TBL`` table in the database;

- Start Glassfish

The shell script below performs the steps above. 
Note that it may or may not work on your system, so it is provided as an example only, downloadable :download:`here </_static/util/clear_timer.sh>`. Aside from the configuration values that need to be changed to reflect your environment (the Glassfish directory, name of the database, etc.) the script relies on the database being configured in a certain way for access. (See the comments in the script for more information)

Timer not working 
-----------------

Dataverse relies on EJB timers to perform scheduled tasks: harvesting from remote servers, updating the local OAI sets and running metadata exports. (See :doc:`timers` for details.) If these scheduled jobs are not running on your server, this may be the result of the incompatibility between the version of PostgreSQL database you are using, and PostgreSQL JDBC driver in use by your instance of Glassfish. The symptoms:

If you are seeing the following in your server.log...

:fixedwidthplain:`Handling timeout on` ...

followed by an Exception stack trace with these lines in it: 

:fixedwidthplain:`Internal Exception: java.io.StreamCorruptedException: invalid stream header` ...

:fixedwidthplain:`Exception Description: Could not deserialize object from byte array` ...


... it most likely means that it is the JDBC driver incompatibility that's preventing the timer from working correctly. 
Make sure you install the correct version of the driver. For example, if you are running the version 9.3 of PostgreSQL, make sure you have the driver postgresql-9.3-1104.jdbc4.jar in your :fixedwidthplain:`<GLASSFISH FOLDER>/glassfish/lib` directory. Go `here <https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html>`_
to download the correct version of the driver. If you have an older driver in glassfish/lib, make sure to remove it, replace it with the new version and restart Glassfish. (You may need to remove the entire contents of :fixedwidthplain:`<GLASSFISH FOLDER>/glassfish/domains/domain1/generated` before you start Glassfish). 


Constraint Violations Issues
----------------------------

In real life production use, it may be possible to end up in a situation where some values associated with the datasets in your database are no longer valid under the constraints enforced by the latest version of Dataverse. This is not very likely to happen, but if it does, the symptomps will be as follows: Some datasets can no longer be edited, long exception stack traces logged in the Glassfish server log, caused by::

   javax.validation.ConstraintViolationException: 
   Bean Validation constraint(s) violated while executing Automatic Bean Validation on callback event:'preUpdate'. 
   Please refer to embedded ConstraintViolations for details.

(contrary to what the message suggests, there are no specific "details" anywhere in the stack trace that would explain what values violate which constraints)  

To identifiy the specific invalid values in the affected datasets, or to check all the datasets in the Dataverse for constraint violations, see :ref:`Dataset Validation <dataset-validation-api>` in the :doc:`/api/native-api` section of the User Guide.
