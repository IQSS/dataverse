"The Guides are reference documents that explain how to use Dataverse, "
"which are divided into the following sections: User Guide, Installation "
"Guide, Developer Guide, and API Guide. The User Guide is further divided "
"into primary activities: finding & using data, adding Datasets, "
"administering dataverses or Datasets, and Dataset "
"exploration/visualizations. Details on all of the those tasks can be "
"found in the Users Guide. The Installation Guide is for people or "
"organizations who want to host their own Dataverse. The Developer Guide "
"contains instructions for people who want to contribute to the Open "
"Source Dataverse project or who want to modify the code to suit their own"
" needs. Finally, the API Guide is for Developers that work on other "
"applications and are interested in connecting with Dataverse through our "
"APIs."
