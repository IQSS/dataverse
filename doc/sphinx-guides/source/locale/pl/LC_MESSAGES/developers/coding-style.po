"IQSS has standardized on Netbeans. It is much appreciated when you format"
" your code (but only the code you touched!) using the out-of-the-box "
"Netbeans configuration. If you have created an entirely new Java class, "
"you can just click Source -> Format. If you are adjusting code in an "
"existing class, highlight the code you changed and then click Source -> "
"Format. Keeping the \"diff\" in your pull requests small makes them "
"easier to code review."

"The easiest way to adopt Dataverse coding style is to use Netbeans as "

"Generally speaking you should use ``fine`` for everything that you don't "

" a higher level such as ``info`` for common operations, you will probably"
