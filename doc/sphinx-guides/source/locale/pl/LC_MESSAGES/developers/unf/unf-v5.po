"UNF Version 5 has been in use by the Dataverse project since 2009. It was"
" built into every version of the DVN, starting with 2.0 and up to 3.6.2. "
"However, some problems were recently found in that implementation. "
"Namely, in certain cases data normalization is not implemented fully to "
"the spec. UNF signatures it generates are still reasonably strong "
"statistically; however, this means that at least some of our signatures "
"are not independently verifiable. I.e., if somebody fully implements "
"their own version of UNF calculator, for certain datasets it would "
"calculate signatures different from those generated by the DVN. Unless of"
" course they implement it with the exact same bugs as ours."

"To address this, the Project is about to release UNF Version 6. The "
"release date is still being discussed. It may coincide with the release "
"of Dataverse 4.0. Alternatively, the production version of DVN 3.6.3 may "
"get upgraded to use UNF v6 prior to that. This will be announced shortly."
" In the process, we are solving another problem with UNF v5 - this time "
"we've made an effort to offer very implementer-friendly documentation "
"that describes the algorithm fully and unambiguously. So if you are "
"interested in implementing your own version of a UNF calculator, "
"(something we would like to encourage!) please proceed directly to the "
"Version 6 documentation."

"Going forward, we are going to offer a preserved version of the Version 5"
" library and, possibly, an online UNF v5 calculator, for the purposes of "
"validating vectors and data sets for which published Version 5 UNFs "
"exist."
