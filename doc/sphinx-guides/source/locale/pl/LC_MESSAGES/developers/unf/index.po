"Universal Numerical Fingerprint (UNF) is a unique signature of the "
"**semantic content** of a digital object. It is **not** simply a checksum"
" of a binary data file. Instead, the UNF algorithm approximates and "
"normalizes the data stored within. A cryptographic hash of that "
"normalized (or canonicalized) representation is then computed. The "
"signature is thus independent of the storage format. E.g., the same data "
"object stored in, say, SPSS and Stata, will have the same UNF."

"Early versions of Dataverse were using the first released implementation "
"of the UNF algorithm (v.3, implemented in R).  Starting with Dataverse "
"2.0 and throughout the 3.* lifecycle, UNF v.5 (implemented in Java) was "
"used. Dataverse 4.0 uses the latest release, UNF v.6. Two parallel "
"implementation, in R and Java, will be available, for cross-validation."
