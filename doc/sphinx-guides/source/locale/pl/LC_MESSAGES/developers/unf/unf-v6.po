"UNF v5, on which v6 is based, was originally described in Dr. Micah "
"Altman's paper \"A Fingerprint Method for Verification of Scientific "
"Data\", Springer Verlag, 2008. The reader is encouraged to consult it for"
" the explanation of the theory behind UNF. However, various changes and "
"clarifications concerning the specifics of normalization have been made "
"to the algorithm since the publication. These crucial details were only "
"documented in the author's unpublished edits of the article and in "
"private correspondence. With this document, a serious effort has been "
"made to produce a complete step-by-step description of the entire "
"process. It should be fully sufficient for the purposes of implementing "
