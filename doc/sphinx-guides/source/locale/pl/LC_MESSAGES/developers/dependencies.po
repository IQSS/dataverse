"Besides the code that glues together the single pieces, any developer "
"needs to describe used dependencies for the Maven-based build system. As "
"is familiar to any Maven user, this happens inside the \"Project Object "
"Model\" (POM) living in ``pom.xml`` at the root of the project "
"repository. Recursive and convergent dependency resolution makes "
"dependency management with Maven very easy. But sometimes, in projects "
"with many complex dependencies like Dataverse, you have to help Maven "
"make the right choices."

"For *implicit usage detection*, use `mvn dependency:analyze`. Examine the"
