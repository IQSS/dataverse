"As a harvesting *server*, your Dataverse can make some of the local "
"dataset metadata available to remote harvesting clients. These can be "
"other Dataverse instances, or any other clients that support OAI-PMH "
"harvesting protocol. Note that the terms \"Harvesting Server\" and \"OAI "
"Server\" are being used interchangeably throughout this guide and in the "
"inline help text."

"Only the published, unrestricted datasets in your Dataverse can be made "

"Once the service is enabled, you define collections of local datasets "

"the terms \"OAI Set\" and \"Harvesting Set\" are used interchangeably. "
"Sets are defined by search queries. Any such query that finds any number "
"of published, local (non-harvested) datasets can be used to create an OAI"
" set. Sets can overlap local dataverses, and can include as few or as "
"many of your local datasets as you wish. A good way to master the "
"Dataverse search query language is to experiment with the Advanced Search"
" page. We also recommend that you consult the Search API section of the "
"Dataverse User Guide."
