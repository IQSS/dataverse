"When running a Dataverse cluster - i.e. multiple Dataverse application "
"servers talking to the same database - **only one** of them must act as "
"the *dedicated timer server*. This is to avoid starting conflicting batch"
" jobs on multiple nodes at the same time."

"This timer runs a daily job that tries to export all the local, published"

"scheduled job is there to catch any datasets for which that export did "
"not succeed, for one reason or another). Also, since this functionality "
"has been added in version 4.5: if you are upgrading from a previous "
"version, none of your datasets are exported yet. So the first time this "
