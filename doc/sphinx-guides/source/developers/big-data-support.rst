Big Data Support
================

Big data support is highly experimental. Eventually this content will move to the Installation Guide.

Various components need to be installed and configured for big data support.

Data Capture Module (DCM)
-------------------------

Data Capture Module (DCM) is an experimental component that allows users to upload large datasets via rsync over ssh.

Install a DCM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installation instructions can be found at https://github.com/sbgrid/data-capture-module . Note that a shared filesystem between Dataverse and your DCM is required. You cannot use a DCM with non-filesystem storage options such as Swift.

Once you have installed a DCM, you will need to configure two database settings on the Dataverse side. These settings are documented in the :doc:`/installation/config` section of the Installation Guide:

- ``:DataCaptureModuleUrl`` should be set to the URL of a DCM you installed.
- ``:UploadMethods`` should be set to ``dcm/rsync+ssh``.
  
This will allow your Dataverse installation to communicate with your DCM, so that Dataverse can download rsync scripts for your users.

Downloading rsync scripts via Dataverse API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The rsync script can be downloaded from Dataverse via API using an authorized API token. In the curl example below, substitute ``$PERSISTENT_ID`` with a DOI or Handle:

``curl -H "X-Dataverse-key: $API_TOKEN" $DV_BASE_URL/api/datasets/:persistentId/dataCaptureModule/rsync?persistentId=$PERSISTENT_ID``

How a DCM reports checksum success or failure to Dataverse
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the user uploads files to a DCM, that DCM will perform checksum validation and report to Dataverse the results of that validation. The DCM must be configured to pass the API token of a superuser. The implementation details, which are subject to change, are below.

The JSON that a DCM sends to Dataverse on successful checksum validation looks something like the contents of :download:`checksumValidationSuccess.json <../_static/installation/files/root/big-data-support/checksumValidationSuccess.json>` below:

.. literalinclude:: ../_static/installation/files/root/big-data-support/checksumValidationSuccess.json
   :language: json

- ``status`` - The valid strings to send are ``validation passed`` and ``validation failed``.
- ``uploadFolder`` - This is the directory on disk where Dataverse should attempt to find the files that a DCM has moved into place. There should always be a ``files.sha`` file and a least one data file. ``files.sha`` is a manifest of all the data files and their checksums. The ``uploadFolder`` directory is inside the directory where data is stored for the dataset and may have the same name as the "identifier" of the persistent id (DOI or Handle). For example, you would send ``"uploadFolder": "DNXV2H"`` in the JSON file when the absolute path to this directory is ``/usr/local/glassfish4/glassfish/domains/domain1/files/10.5072/FK2/DNXV2H/DNXV2H``.
- ``totalSize`` - Dataverse will use this value to represent the total size in bytes of all the files in the "package" that's created. If 360 data files and one ``files.sha`` manifest file are in the ``uploadFolder``, this value is the sum of the 360 data files.


Here's the syntax for sending the JSON.

``curl -H "X-Dataverse-key: $API_TOKEN" -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' --upload-file checksumValidationSuccess.json $DV_BASE_URL/api/datasets/:persistentId/dataCaptureModule/checksumValidation?persistentId=$PERSISTENT_ID``


Steps to set up a DCM mock for Development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install Flask.


Download and run the mock. You will be cloning the https://github.com/sbgrid/data-capture-module repo.

- ``git clone git://github.com/sbgrid/data-capture-module.git``
- ``cd data-capture-module/api``
- ``./dev_mock.sh``

If you see an error about not having Flask installed, install it as explained below.

On Mac, you can install Flask with:

- ``mkvirtualenv mockdcm``
- ``pip install -r requirements-mock.txt``

On Ubuntu/Debian, you can install Flask with:

- ``sudo apt install python-pip`` (will install python as well)
- ``pip install flask``

Once you have Flask installed, try running the dev mock script again:

- ``./dev_mock.sh``

This should spin up the DCM mock on port 5000.

Add Dataverse settings to use mock (same as using DCM, noted above):

- ``curl http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:DataCaptureModuleUrl -X PUT -d "http://localhost:5000"``
- ``curl http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:UploadMethods -X PUT -d "dcm/rsync+ssh"``

At this point you should be able to download a placeholder rsync script. Dataverse is then waiting for new from the DCM about if checksum validation has succeeded or not. First, you have to put files in place, which is usually the job of the DCM. You should substitute "X1METO" for the "identifier" of the dataset you create. You must also use the proper path for where you store files in your dev environment.

- ``mkdir /usr/local/glassfish4/glassfish/domains/domain1/files/10.5072/FK2/X1METO``
- ``mkdir /usr/local/glassfish4/glassfish/domains/domain1/files/10.5072/FK2/X1METO/X1METO``
- ``cd /usr/local/glassfish4/glassfish/domains/domain1/files/10.5072/FK2/X1METO/X1METO``
- ``echo "hello" > file1.txt``
- ``shasum file1.txt > files.sha``

Now the files are in place and you need to send JSON to Dataverse with a success or failure message as described above. Make a copy of ``doc/sphinx-guides/source/_static/installation/files/root/big-data-support/checksumValidationSuccess.json`` and put the identifier in place such as "X1METO" under "uploadFolder"). Then use curl as described above to send the JSON.

Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following low level command should only be used when troubleshooting the "import" code a DCM uses but is documented here for completeness.

``curl -H "X-Dataverse-key: $API_TOKEN" -X POST "$DV_BASE_URL/api/batch/jobs/import/datasets/files/$DATASET_DB_ID?uploadFolder=$UPLOAD_FOLDER&totalSize=$TOTAL_SIZE"``
