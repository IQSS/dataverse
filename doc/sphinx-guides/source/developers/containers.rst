==================================

The Dataverse community is exploring the use of Docker, Kubernetes, and other container-related technologies.

Container Guide
---------------

We recommend starting with the :doc:`/container/index`. The core Dataverse development team, with lots of help from the community, is iterating on containerizing the Dataverse software and its dependencies there.

Help Containerize Dataverse
---------------------------

If you would like to contribute to the containerization effort, please consider joining the `Containerization Working Group <https://dataverse.org/working-groups#cwg>`_.

Community-Lead Projects
-----------------------

The primary community-lead projects (which the core team is drawing inspiration from!) are:

- https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-docker
- https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-kubernetes (especially the https://github.com/EOSC-synergy/dataverse-kubernetes fork)

Using Containers for Reproducible Research
------------------------------------------

Please see :ref:`research-code` in the User Guide for this related topic.
