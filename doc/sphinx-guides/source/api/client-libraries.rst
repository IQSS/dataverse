Client Libraries
================

Currently there are client libraries for Python and R that can be used to develop against Dataverse APIs.

Because Dataverse is a SWORD server, additional client libraries exist for Java, Ruby, and PHP per the :doc:`/api/sword` page.

Python
------

https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-client-python is the offical Python package for Dataverse APIs.

`Robert Liebowitz <https://github.com/rliebz>`_ from the `Center for Open Science <http://centerforopenscience.org>`_ heads its development and the library is used to integrate the `Open Science Framework (OSF) <http://osf.io>`_ with Dataverse via an add-on which itself is open source and listed on the :doc:`/api/apps` page.

R
-

https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-client-r is the official R package for Dataverse APIs.

It was created by `Thomas Leeper <http://thomasleeper.com>`_ whose dataverse can be found at https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/leeper
