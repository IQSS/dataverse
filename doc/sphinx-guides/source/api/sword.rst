SWORD API
=========

SWORD_ stands for "Simple Web-service Offering Repository Deposit" and is a "profile" of AtomPub (`RFC 5023`_) which is a RESTful API that allows non-Dataverse software to deposit files and metadata into a Dataverse installation. :ref:`client-libraries` are available in Python, Java, R, Ruby, and PHP.

Introduced in Dataverse Network (DVN) `3.6 <https://github.com/IQSS/dvn/blob/develop/doc/sphinx/source/dataverse-api-main.rst#data-deposit-api>`_, the SWORD API was formerly known as the "Data Deposit API" and ``data-deposit/v1`` appeared in the URLs. For backwards compatibility these URLs will continue to work (with deprecation warnings). Due to architectural changes in Dataverse 4.0, a few minor backward incompatible changes were necessarily introduced and for this reason the version has been increased to ``v1.1``. For details, see :ref:`incompatible`.

Dataverse implements most of SWORDv2_, which is specified at http://swordapp.github.io/SWORDv2-Profile/SWORDProfile.html . Please reference the `SWORDv2 specification`_ for expected HTTP status codes (i.e. 201, 204, 404, etc.), headers (i.e. "Location"), etc. For a quick introduction to SWORD, the two minute video at http://cottagelabs.com/news/intro-to-sword-2 is recommended.

Backward incompatible changes
-----------------------------

Differences in Dataverse 4.0 have lead to a few minor backward incompatible changes in the Dataverse implementation of SWORD, which are listed below. Old ``v1`` URLs should continue to work but the ``Service Document`` will contain a deprecation warning and responses will contain ``v1.1`` URLs. See also :ref:`known-issues`.

- Newly required fields when creating/editing datasets for compliance with the `Joint Declaration for Data Citation principles <http://thedata.org/blog/joint-declaration-data-citation-principles-and-dataverse>`_.

  - dcterms:creator (maps to authorName)

  - dcterms:description

- Deaccessioning is no longer supported. An alternative is being developed at https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/778

- The Service Document will show a single Account Terms of Use rather than root level and dataverse level Deposit Terms of Use per https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/551#issuecomment-60762177

New features as of v1.1
-----------------------

- An API token can be used in place of a username and password. In the ``curl`` examples below, you will see ``curl -u $USERNAME:$PASSWORD`` but you can pass an API token for ``$USERNAME`` and nothing (or a random value) for ``$PASSWORD`` to authenticate. For example, if your API token is ``54b143b5-d001-4254-afc0-a1c0f6a5b5a7`` you can use ``curl -u 54b143b5-d001-4254-afc0-a1c0f6a5b5a7:`` or ``curl -u 54b143b5-d001-4254-afc0-a1c0f6a5b5a7:foobar`` to authenticate.

- Dataverses can be published via SWORD

- Datasets versions will only be increased to the next minor version (i.e. 1.1) rather than a major version (2.0) if possible. This depends on the nature of the change.

- Granular permissions are used for certain operations. Previously, you needed to be "admin" on a dataverse to use the Data Deposit API at all.

  - The Service Document will return all the dataverses on which you have the "AddDataset" permission. This should resolve the issue reported at https://trello.com/c/F2ZQPFdM/6-reconcile-what-is-seen-by-the-data-deposit-api-and-the-gui-currently-python-api-hides-dvs-from-admin-unless-it-is-also-dv-creato 

- "Author Affiliation" can be populated with an XML attribute. For example: <dcterms:creator affiliation="Coffee Bean State University">Stumptown, Jane</dcterms:creator>

- "Contributor" can now be populated and the "Type" (Editor, Funder, Researcher, etc.) can be specified with an XML attribute. For example: <dcterms:contributor type="Funder">CaffeineForAll</dcterms:contributor>

- "Contact E-mail" is automatically populated from dataset owners email.

- "Subject" is automatically populated with "N/A". #769 

- Zero-length files are now allowed (but not necessarily encouraged) #753


curl examples
-------------

Retrieve SWORD service document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The service document enumerates the dataverses ("collections" from a SWORD perspective) the user can deposit data into. The "collectionPolicy" element for each dataverse contains the Terms of Use.

``curl -u $USERNAME:$PASSWORD https://$HOSTNAME/dvn/api/data-deposit/v1.1/swordv2/service-document``

Create a dataset with an Atom entry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``curl -u $USERNAME:$PASSWORD --data-binary "@path/to/atom-entry-study.xml" -H "Content-Type: application/atom+xml" https://$HOSTNAME/dvn/api/data-deposit/v1.1/swordv2/collection/dataverse/$DATAVERSE_ALIAS``

Example Atom entry (XML)::

List datasets in a dataverse
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``curl -u $USERNAME:$PASSWORD https://$HOSTNAME/dvn/api/data-deposit/v1.1/swordv2/collection/dataverse/$DATAVERSE_ALIAS``

Add files to a dataset with a zip file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``curl -u $USERNAME:$PASSWORD --data-binary @path/to/example.zip -H "Content-Disposition: filename=example.zip" -H "Content-Type: application/zip" -H "Packaging: http://purl.org/net/sword/package/SimpleZip" https://$HOSTNAME/dvn/api/data-deposit/v1.1/swordv2/edit-media/study/doi:TEST/12345``

Display a dataset atom entry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Contains data citation (bibliographicCitation), alternate URI (persistent URI of study), edit URI, edit media URI, statement URI.

``curl -u $USERNAME:$PASSWORD https://$HOSTNAME/dvn/api/data-deposit/v1.1/swordv2/edit/study/doi:TEST/12345``

Display a dataset statement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Contains title, author, feed of file entries, latestVersionState, locked boolean, updated timestamp.

``curl -u $USERNAME:$PASSWORD https://$HOSTNAME/dvn/api/data-deposit/v1.1/swordv2/statement/study/doi:TEST/12345``

Delete a file by database id
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``curl -u $USERNAME:$PASSWORD -X DELETE https://$HOSTNAME/dvn/api/data-deposit/v1.1/swordv2/edit-media/file/123``

Replacing metadata for a dataset
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please note that **ALL** metadata (title, author, etc.) will be replaced, including fields that can not be expressed with "dcterms" fields.

``curl -u $USERNAME:$PASSWORD --upload-file "path/to/atom-entry-study2.xml" -H "Content-Type: application/atom+xml" https://$HOSTNAME/dvn/api/data-deposit/v1.1/swordv2/edit/study/doi:TEST/12345``

Delete a dataset
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``curl -u $USERNAME:$PASSWORD -i -X DELETE https://$HOSTNAME/dvn/api/data-deposit/v1.1/swordv2/edit/study/doi:TEST/12345``

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Look for a `dataverseHasBeenReleased` boolean.

``curl -u $USERNAME:$PASSWORD https://$HOSTNAME/dvn/api/data-deposit/v1.1/swordv2/collection/dataverse/$DATAVERSE_ALIAS``

Publish a dataverse
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``cat /dev/null`` and ``--data-binary @-`` arguments are used to send zero-length content to the API, which is required by the upstream library to process the ``In-Progress: false`` header.

``cat /dev/null | curl -u $USERNAME:$PASSWORD -X POST -H "In-Progress: false" --data-binary @- https://$HOSTNAME/dvn/api/data-deposit/v1.1/swordv2/edit/dataverse/$DATAVERSE_ALIAS``

``cat /dev/null | curl -u $USERNAME:$PASSWORD -X POST -H "In-Progress: false" --data-binary @- https://$HOSTNAME/dvn/api/data-deposit/v1.1/swordv2/edit/study/doi:TEST/12345``

.. _known-issues:

Known issues
------------

Most of these known issues are expected to be fixed before the release of Dataverse 4.0:

- Permission checking is more strict than necessary. Inheritance of permissions is not honored ( https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/784#issuecomment-60151937 ) and many SWORD operations still require the equivalent of "admin" ( https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/1070 ).

- The ``Service Document`` does not yet contain a real ``collectionPolicy``/Terms of Use: https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/551

- dcterms:rights needs to be mapped "restrictions" or some other Dataverse field for SWORD: https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/805

- File categories are no longer created from zip files: https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/303

- DOIs are not real: https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/757

- Mismatch between id and identifier for datasets in dvobject table: https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/758

- Should see all the fields filled in for a dataset regardless of what the parent dataverse specifies: https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/756

- Inefficiency in constructing the ``Service Document``: https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/784

- Inefficiency in constructing the list of datasets: https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/784

- SWORD does not reflect the hierarchy of dataverses in a tree structure: https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/235#issuecomment-60132514

Roadmap
-------

These are features we'd like to add in the future:

- Implement SWORD 2.0 Profile 6.4: https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/183

- Support deaccessioning via API: https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/778

- Like the GUI, auto-populate "Depositor" and "Deposit Date": https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/457

- Populate "Subject" from parent dataverse rather than always using "Other": https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/769

- Let file metadata (i.e. description) be specified during zip upload: https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/723

- SWORD: Display of actual dcterms xml element for equivalent of required field not found: https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/1019

Bug fixes in v1.1
