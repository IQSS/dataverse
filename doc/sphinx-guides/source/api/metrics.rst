Metrics API
===========

The Metrics API provides counts of downloads, datasets created, files uploaded, and more, as described below. The Dataverse Software also includes aggregate counts of Make Data Count metrics (described in the :doc:`/admin/make-data-count` section of the Admin Guide and available per-Dataset through the :doc:`/api/native-api`). A table of all the endpoints is listed below.

.. note:: |CORS| The Metrics API can be used from scripts running in web browsers, as it allows cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).

.. note:: For all metrics `besides` Past Days Count (``/pastDays/$days``) - recalculated daily, and (``/toMonth/$month``) for prior months - never recalculated, the setting ``MetricsCacheTimeoutMinutes`` defines how long the cached value will be returned by subsequent queries.

Categories
----------

The Metrics API includes several categories of endpoints that provide different ways of understanding the evolution of metrics over time:

* Total - an aggregate count over all-time:

  * Form: GET https://$SERVER/api/info/metrics/$type

  * where ``$type`` can be set, for example, to ``dataverses`` (Dataverse collections), ``datasets``, ``files`` or ``downloads``.

  * Example: ``curl https://demo.dataverse.org/api/info/metrics/downloads``

  * Return: Most of these calls return a simple JSON object with a ``count`` whose value is the metric's total count. Some calls, such as ``filedownloads`` return aggregate metrics per item (e.g. per file or by subject) as a JSONArray or CSV (see Return Formats below)

* To-Month - a count of various objects in dataverse up to and including a specified month ``$YYYY-DD`` in YYYY-MM format (e.g. ``2018-01``):

  * Form: GET https://$SERVER/api/info/metrics/$type/toMonth/$YYYY-DD

  * where ``$type`` can be set, for example, to ``dataverses`` (Dataverse collections), ``datasets``, ``files`` or ``downloads``.

  * Example: ``curl https://demo.dataverse.org/api/info/metrics/dataverses/toMonth/2018-01``
    
  * Return: Most of these calls return a simple JSON object with a ``count`` whose value is the metric's total count. One variant, ``/api/info/metrics/datasets/bySubject/toMonth`` return aggregate metrics per Dataset Subject as a JSONArray or CSV (see Return Formats below)

* Past Days - a count of various objects in a Dataverse installation for the past ``$days`` (e.g. ``30``):

  * Form: GET https://$SERVER/api/info/metrics/$type/pastDays/$days

  * where ``$type`` can be set, for example, to ``dataverses`` (Dataverse collections), ``datasets``, ``files`` or ``downloads``.

  * Example: ``curl https://demo.dataverse.org/api/info/metrics/datasets/pastDays/30``

  * Return: A simple JSON object with a ``count`` whose value is the metric's total count.

* Monthly - a time series of the metric with aggregate values per month with counts up to and including the given month:

  * Form: GET https://$SERVER/api/info/metrics/$type/monthly

  * where ``$type`` can be set, for example, to ``dataverses`` (Dataverse collections), ``datasets``, ``files`` or ``downloads``.

  * Example: ``curl https://demo.dataverse.org/api/info/metrics/downloads/monthly``

  * Return: A JSON Array or CSV file with an array of counts per month. Variants of this this category that provide a time series per object return that information in the same formats (JSON array, CSV) with one time-series column per item (see Return Formats below).

* Tree - endpoints that describe the structure of the tree of published Dataverses, as of now or as of the end of a specified month. The monthly version could be used to show growth of the Dataverse instance over time, but the initial use case for these endpoints was to provide a means to list the tree in a selection widget to scope the metrics displayed in the local Dataverse metrics page in the `dataverse-metrics app <https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-metrics>`_.

  * Form: GET https://$SERVER/api/info/metrics/tree
  * or
  * Form: GET https://$SERVER/api/info/metrics/tree/toMonth/$YYYY-DD

  * Example: ``curl https://demo.dataverse.org/api/info/metrics/tree``

  * Return: A nested JSON array containing JSON objects for each Dataverse collection with key/values for id, ownerId, alias, depth, and name, and a JSON array containing analogous objects for Dataverse collections within the current one.

Return Formats
--------------

There are a number of API calls that provide time series, information reported per item (e.g. per dataset, per file, by subject, by category, and by file Mimetype), or both (time series per item). Because these calls all report more than a single number, the API provides two optional formats for the return that can be selected by specifying an HTTP Accept Header for the desired format:

* application/json - a JSON array of objects. For time-series, the objects include key/values for the ``date`` and ``count`` for that month. For per-item calls, the objects include the item (e.g. for a subject), or it's id/pid (for a dataset or datafile). For timeseries per-item, the objects also include a date. In all cases, the response is a single array.

  * Example: ``curl -H 'Accept:application/json' https://demo.dataverse.org/api/info/metrics/downloads/monthly``

* comma-separated-value (CSV) - a CSV file with rows corresponding to each JSON object in the application/json format. Column headers are included (e.g. ``date,count`` or ``subject,count`` or ``date,pid,id,count`` (for a time series per file)).

  * Example: ``curl -H 'Accept:text/csv' https://demo.dataverse.org/api/info/metrics/downloads/monthly``

  * The default format is CSV, so ``curl https://demo.dataverse.org/api/info/metrics/downloads/monthly``, or typing this URL into a browser return the CSV format.

Filtering with Query Parameters
-------------------------------

To further tailor your metric, query parameters can be provided. On relevant endpoints, these query parameters can be used together.

parentAlias
~~~~~~~~~~~

Specifies which Dataverse sub-collection the metric should be collected for. Not including this parameter gathers metrics for the entire instance.

Example: ``curl https://demo.dataverse.org/api/info/metrics/datasets/?parentAlias=abc`` would return the number of datasets in the Dataverse collection with alias 'abc' and in sub-collections within it.

dataLocation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Specifies whether the metric should query ``local`` data, ``remote`` data (e.g. harvested), or ``all`` data when getting results. Only works for dataset metrics.

Example: ``curl https://demo.dataverse.org/api/info/metrics/datasets/?dataLocation=remote``

country
~~~~~~~

The Make Data Count endpoints are also able to filter results by Country (specified using the ISO 3166 Country codes)

Example: ``curl https://demo.dataverse.org/api/info/metrics/makeDataCount/viewsTotal?country=au``



Endpoint Table
--------------

The following table lists the available metrics endpoints (not including the Make Data Counts endpoints a single dataset which are part of the :doc:`/api/native-api`) along with additional notes about them.
