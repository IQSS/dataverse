Apps
====

The introduction of Dataverse APIs has fostered the development of apps that are listed at http://dataverse.org/integrations and the :doc:`/admin/integrations` section of the Admin Guide.

The apps below are open source, demonstrating how to use Dataverse APIs. Some of these apps (and others) are built on :doc:`/api/client-libraries` that are available for Dataverse APIs.

DVUploader
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The open-source DVUploader tool is a stand-alone command-line Java application that uses the Dataverse API to upload files to a specified Dataset. Files can be specified by name, or the DVUploader can upload all files in a directory or recursively from a directory tree. The DVUploader can also verify that uploaded files match their local sources by comparing the local and remote fixity checksums. Source code, release 1.0.0- jar file, and documentation are available on GitHub. DVUploader's creation was supported by the Texas Digital Library.
