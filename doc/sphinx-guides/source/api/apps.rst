Apps
====

The introduction of Dataverse APIs has fostered the development of a variety of software applications that are listed in the :doc:`/admin/integrations`, :doc:`/admin/external-tools`, and :doc:`/admin/reporting-tools-and-queries` sections of the Admin Guide.

The apps below are open source and demonstrate how to use Dataverse APIs. Some of these apps are built on :doc:`/api/client-libraries` that are available for Dataverse APIs in Python, Javascript, R, and Java.
