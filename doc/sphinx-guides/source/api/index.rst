API Guide
=========

We strongly encourage anyone interested in building tools to
interoperate with the Dataverse Network to utilize our open source
APIs. Please visit http://datascience.iq.harvard.edu/collaborations for
examples of external apps that have been built to work with our APIs.

Rather than using a production installation of Dataverse, API users are
welcome to use http://apitest.dataverse.org for testing.
