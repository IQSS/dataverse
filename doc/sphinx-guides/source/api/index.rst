   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

API Guide
=========

We encourage anyone interested in building tools to
interoperate with the Dataverse to utilize our 
APIs. In 4.0, we require to get a token, by simply registering for a Dataverse account, before using our APIs 
(We are considering making some of the APIs completley public in the future - no token required - if you use it only a few times).

Rather than using a production installation of Dataverse, API users should use http://apitest.dataverse.org for testing.
