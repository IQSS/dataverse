API Tokens and Authentication 
=============================

An API token is similar to a password and allows you to authenticate to Dataverse Software APIs to perform actions as you. Many Dataverse Software APIs require the use of an API token.

How to Get an API Token
-----------------------

Your API token is unique to the server you are using. You cannot take your API token from one server and use it on another server.

Instructions for getting a token are described in the :doc:`/user/account` section of the User Guide.

How Your API Token Is Like a Password
-------------------------------------

Anyone who has your API Token can add and delete data as you so you should treat it with the same care as a password.

Passing Your API Token as an HTTP Header (Preferred) or a Query Parameter
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: The SWORD API uses a different way of passing the API token. Please see :ref:`sword-auth` for details.

See :ref:`curl-examples-and-environment-variables` if you are unfamiliar with the use of ``export`` below.

There are two ways to pass your API token to Dataverse Software APIs. The preferred method is to send the token in the ``X-Dataverse-key`` HTTP header, as in the following curl example.

.. code-block:: bash

  export API_TOKEN=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
  export SERVER_URL=https://demo.dataverse.org
  export ALIAS=root

  curl -H X-Dataverse-key:$API_TOKEN $SERVER_URL/api/dataverses/$ALIAS/contents

Here's how it looks without the environment variables:

.. code-block:: bash

  curl -H X-Dataverse-key:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx https://demo.dataverse.org/api/dataverses/root/contents

The second way to pass your API token is via a query parameter called ``key`` in the URL like below.

.. code-block:: bash

  export API_TOKEN=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
  export SERVER_URL=https://demo.dataverse.org
  export ALIAS=root

  curl $SERVER_URL/api/dataverses/$ALIAS/contents?key=$API_TOKEN

Here's how it looks without the environment variables:

.. code-block:: bash

  curl https://demo.dataverse.org/api/dataverses/root/contents?key=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx

Use of the ``X-Dataverse-key`` HTTP header form is preferred to passing ``key`` in the URL because query parameters like ``key`` appear in URLs and might accidentally get shared, exposing your API token. (Again it's like a password.) Additionally, URLs are often logged on servers while it's less common to log HTTP headers.

Resetting Your API Token
------------------------

You can reset your API Token from your account page in your Dataverse installation as described in the :doc:`/user/account` section of the User Guide.

.. _bearer-tokens:

Bearer Tokens
-------------

Bearer tokens are defined in `RFC 6750`_ and can be used as an alternative to API tokens if your installation has been set up to use them (see :ref:`bearer-token-auth` in the Installation Guide).

.. _RFC 6750: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750

To test if bearer tokens are working, you can try something like the following (using the :ref:`User Information` API endpoint), substituting in parameters for your installation and user.

.. code-block:: bash

  export TOKEN=`curl -s -X POST --location "http://keycloak.mydomain.com:8090/realms/test/protocol/openid-connect/token" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "username=user&password=user&grant_type=password&client_id=test&client_secret=94XHrfNRwXsjqTqApRrwWmhDLDHpIYV8" | jq '.access_token' -r | tr -d "\n"`
  
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8080/api/users/:me

To register a new user who has authenticated via an OIDC provider, the following endpoint should be used:

.. code-block:: bash

  curl  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/users/register --data '{"termsAccepted":true}'

If the feature flag ``api-bearer-auth-handle-tos-acceptance-in-idp``` is disabled, it is essential to send a JSON that includes the property ``termsAccepted``` set to true, indicating that you accept the Terms of Use of the installation. Otherwise, you will not be able to create an account. However, if the feature flag is enabled, Terms of Service acceptance is handled by the identity provider, and it is no longer necessary to include the ``termsAccepted``` parameter in the JSON.

In this JSON, we can also include the fields ``position`` or ``affiliation``, in the same way as when we register a user through the Dataverse UI. These fields are optional, and if not provided, they will be persisted as empty in Dataverse.

There is another flag called ``api-bearer-auth-provide-missing-claims`` that can be enabled to allow sending missing user claims in the registration JSON. This is useful when the identity provider does not supply the necessary claims. However, this flag will only be considered if the ``api-bearer-auth`` feature flag is enabled. If the latter is not enabled, the ``api-bearer-auth-provide-missing-claims`` flag will be ignored.

With the ``api-bearer-auth-provide-missing-claims`` feature flag enabled, you can include the following properties in the request JSON:

- ``username``
- ``firstName``
- ``lastName``
- ``emailAddress``

If properties are provided in the JSON, but corresponding claims already exist in the identity provider, an error will be thrown, outlining the conflicting properties.

This functionality is included under a feature flag because using it may introduce user impersonation issues, for example if the identity provider does not provide an email field and the user submits an email address they do not own.
