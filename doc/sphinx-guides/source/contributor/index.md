The Global Dataverse Community Consortium (GDCC) helps coordinate community efforts and sustain the software and community in the long term. Please consider contributing to GDCC by joining as an institutional member (<https://www.gdcc.io/members.html>).

## Artwork

Surely we can put artistic talent to use. A contributor [drew cartoon animals chatting about Dataverse](https://github.com/IQSS/chat.dataverse.org/issues/18), for example.

As [annnounced](https://groups.google.com/g/dataverse-community/c/pM39_9O5Rug/m/CK-gJqZFBgAJ), we have a [sticker template](https://dataverse.org/sites/projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/dataverseorg/files/dataverse_community_stickers_template.zip) you can use.

See [Illustrations from The Turing Way](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3332807) for how that community has created artwork. Perhaps we can create a similar collection.
