=============
Configuration
=============

Now that you've successfully logged into Dataverse with a superuser account after going through a basic :doc:`installation-main`, you'll need to secure and configure your installation.

Settings within Dataverse itself are managed via JVM options or by manipulating values in the ``setting`` table directly or through API calls. Configuring Solr requires manipulating XML files.

Once you have finished securing and configuring your Dataverse installation, proceed to the :doc:`administration` section. Advanced configuration topics are covered in the :doc:`r-rapache-tworavens`, :doc:`shibboleth` and :doc:`oauth2` sections.

Securing Your Installation
--------------------------

Changing the Superuser Password
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The default password for the "dataverseAdmin" superuser account is "admin", as mentioned in the :doc:`installation-main` section, and you should change it, of course.

Blocking API Endpoints
++++++++++++++++++++++

The :doc:`/api/native-api` contains a useful but potentially dangerous API endpoint called "admin" that allows you to change system settings, make ordinary users into superusers, and more. The ``builtin-users`` endpoint lets people create a local/builtin user account if they know the ``BuiltinUsers.KEY`` value described below.

By default, all APIs can be operated on remotely and a number of endpoints do not require authentication. https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/1886 was opened to explore changing these defaults, but until then it is very important to block both the "admin" endpoint (and at least consider blocking ``builtin-users``). For details please see also the section on ``:BlockedApiPolicy`` below.

Forcing HTTPS
+++++++++++++

To avoid having your users send credentials in the clear, it's strongly recommended to force all web traffic to go through HTTPS (port 443) rather than HTTP (port 80). The ease with which one can install a valid SSL cert into Apache compared with the same operation in Glassfish might be a compelling enough reason to front Glassfish with Apache. In addition, Apache can be configured to rewrite HTTP to HTTPS with rules such as those found at https://wiki.apache.org/httpd/RewriteHTTPToHTTPS or in the section on :doc:`shibboleth`.

Additional Recommendations
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To further enhance the security of your installation, we recommend taking the following specific actions:

- Configure Glassfish to run as a user other than root.
- Remove /root/.glassfish/pass password files.
- Store passwords as a hash rather than base64 encoded. Ideally this will be a salted hash, and use a strong hashing algorithm.
- Use a strong administrator password so the hash cannot easily be cracked through dictionary attacks.

Solr
----

schema.xml
++++++++++

The :doc:`prerequisites` section explained that Dataverse requires a specific Solr schema file called ``schema.xml`` that can be found in the Dataverse distribution. You should have already replaced the default ``example/solr/collection1/conf/schema.xml`` file that ships with Solr.

jetty.xml
+++++++++

Stop Solr and edit ``solr-4.6.0/example/etc/jetty.xml`` to add a line having to do with ``requestHeaderSize`` as follows:

.. code-block:: xml

    <Call name="addConnector">
      <Arg>
          <New class="org.eclipse.jetty.server.bio.SocketConnector">
            <Set name="host"><SystemProperty name="jetty.host" /></Set>
            <Set name="port"><SystemProperty name="jetty.port" default="8983"/></Set>
            <Set name="maxIdleTime">50000</Set>
            <Set name="lowResourceMaxIdleTime">1500</Set>
            <Set name="statsOn">false</Set>
            <Set name="requestHeaderSize">102400</Set>
          </New>
      </Arg>
    </Call>

Without this ``requestHeaderSize`` line in place, which increases the default size, it will appear that no data has been added to your Dataverse installation and ``WARN  org.eclipse.jetty.http.HttpParser  â€“ HttpParser Full for /127.0.0.1:8983`` will appear in the Solr log.

Network Ports
-------------

Remember how under "Decisions to Make" in the :doc:`prep` section we mentioned you'll need to make a decision about whether or not to introduce a proxy in front of Dataverse such as Apache or nginx? The time has come to make that decision.

The need to redirect port HTTP (port 80) to HTTPS (port 443) for security has already been mentioned above and the fact that Glassfish puts these services on 8080 and 8181, respectively, was touched on in the :doc:`installation-main` section. In production, you don't want to tell your users to use Dataverse on ports 8080 and 8181. You should have them use the stardard HTTPS port, which is 443.

Your decision to proxy or not should primarily be driven by which features of Dataverse you'd like to use. If you'd like to use Shibboleth, the decision is easy because proxying or "fronting" Glassfish with Apache is required. The details are covered in the :doc:`shibboleth` section.

If you'd like to use TwoRavens, you should also consider fronting with Apache because you will be required to install an Apache anyway to make use of the rApache module. For details, see the :doc:`r-rapache-tworavens` section.

Even if you have no interest in Shibboleth nor TwoRavens, you may want to front Dataverse with Apache or nginx to simply the process of installing SSL certificates. There are many tutorials on the Internet for adding certs to Apache, including a some `notes used by the Dataverse team <https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/blob/v4.6.1/doc/shib/shib.md>`_, but the process of adding a certificate to Glassfish is arduous and not for the faint of heart. The Dataverse team cannot provide much help with adding certificates to Glassfish beyond linking to `tips <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/906402/importing-an-existing-x509-certificate-and-private-key-in-java-keystore-to-use-i>`_ on the web.

Still not convinced you should put Glassfish behind another web server? Even if you manage to get your SSL certificate into Glassfish, how are you going to run Glassfish on low ports such as 80 and 443? Are you going to run Glassfish as root? Bad idea. This is a security risk. Under "Additional Recommendations" under "Securing Your Installation" above you are advised to configure Glassfish to run as a user other than root. (The Dataverse team will close https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/1934 after updating the Glassfish init script provided in the :doc:`prerequisites` section to not require root.)

There's also the issue of serving a production-ready version of robots.txt. By using a proxy such as Apache, this is a one-time "set it and forget it" step as explained below in the "Going Live" section.

If you are convinced you'd like to try fronting Glassfish with Apache, the :doc:`shibboleth` section should be good resource for you.

If you really don't want to front Glassfish with any proxy (not recommended), you can configure Glassfish to run HTTPS on port 443 like this:

``asadmin set server-config.network-config.network-listeners.network-listener.http-listener-2.port=443``

What about port 80? Even if you don't front Dataverse with Apache, you may want to let Apache run on port 80 just to rewrite HTTP to HTTPS as described above. You can use a similar command as above to change the HTTP port that Glassfish uses from 8080 to 80 (substitute ``http-listener-1.port=80``). Glassfish can be used to enforce HTTPS on its own without Apache, but configuring this is an exercise for the reader.

Root Dataverse Configuration
----------------------------

The user who creates a dataverse is given the "Admin" role on that dataverse. The root dataverse is created automatically for you by the installer and the "Admin" is the superuser account ("dataverseAdmin") we used in the :doc:`installation-main` section to confirm that we can log in. These next steps of configuring the root dataverse require the "Admin" role on the root dataverse, but not the much more powerful superuser attribute. In short, users with the "Admin" role are subject to the permission system. A superuser, on the other hand, completely bypasses the permission system. You can give non-superusers the "Admin" role on the root dataverse if you'd like them to configure the root dataverse.

Root Dataverse Permissions
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In order for non-superusers to start creating dataverses or datasets, you need click "Edit" then "Permissions" and make choices about which users can add dataverses or datasets within the root dataverse. (There is an API endpoint for this operation as well.) Again, the user who creates a dataverse will be granted the "Admin" role on that dataverse.

Publishing the Root Dataverse
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Non-superusers who are not "Admin" on the root dataverse will not be able to to do anything useful until the root dataverse has been published.

Persistent Identifiers and Publishing Datasets
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Persistent identifiers are a required and integral part of the Dataverse platform. They provide a URL that is guaranteed to resolve to the datasets they represent. Dataverse currently supports creating identifiers using DOI and additionally displaying identifiers created using HDL. By default and for testing convenience, the installer configures a temporary DOI test namespace through EZID. This is sufficient to create and publish datasets but they are not citable nor guaranteed to be preserved. To properly configure persistent identifiers for a production installation, an account and associated namespace must be acquired for a fee from one of two DOI providers: EZID (http://ezid.cdlib.org)  or DataCite (https://www.datacite.org). Once account credentials and DOI namespace have been acquired, please complete the following identifier configuration parameters:

JVM Options: :ref:`doi.baseurlstring`, :ref:`doi.username`, :ref:`doi.password`

Database Settings: :ref:`:DoiProvider <:DoiProvider>`, :ref:`:Protocol <:Protocol>`, :ref:`:Authority <:Authority>`, :ref:`:DoiSeparator <:DoiSeparator>`

Please note that any datasets creating using the test configuration cannot be directly migrated and would need to be created again once a valid DOI namespace is configured.

Customizing the Root Dataverse
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As the person installing Dataverse you may or may not be local metadata expert. You may want to have others sign up for accounts and grant them the "Admin" role at the root dataverse to configure metadata fields, browse/search facets, templates, guestbooks, etc. For more on these topics, consult the :doc:`/user/dataverse-management` section of the User Guide.

Once this configuration is complete, your Dataverse installation should be ready for users to start playing with it. That said, there are many more configuration options available, which will be explained below.

Auth Modes: Local vs. Remote vs. Both
-------------------------------------

There are three valid configurations or modes for authenticating users to Dataverse:

- Local only (also known as "builtin" or "Username/Email").
- Both local and remote (Shibboleth and/or OAuth).
- Remote (Shibboleth and/or OAuth) only.

Out of the box, Dataverse is configured in "local only" mode. The "dataverseAdmin" superuser account mentioned in the :doc:`/installation/installation-main` section is an example of a local account. Internally, these accounts are called "builtin" because they are built in to the Dataverse application itself.

To configure Shibboleth see the :doc:`shibboleth` section and to configure OAuth see the :doc:`oauth2` section.

The ``authenticationproviderrow`` database table controls which "authentication providers" are available within Dataverse. Out of the box, a single row with an id of "builtin" will be present. For each user in Dataverse, the ``authenticateduserlookup`` table will have a value under ``authenticationproviderid`` that matches this id. For example, the default "dataverseAdmin" user will have the value "builtin" under  ``authenticationproviderid``. Why is this important? Users are tied to a specific authentication provider but conversion mechanisms are available to switch a user from one authentication provider to the other. As explained in the :doc:`/user/account` section of the User Guide, a graphical workflow is provided for end users to convert from the "builtin" authentication provider to a remote provider. Conversion from a remote authentication provider to the builtin provider can be performed by a sysadmin with access to the "admin" API. See the :doc:`/api/native-api` section of the API Guide for how to list users and authentication providers as JSON.

Enabling a second authentication provider will result in the Log In page showing additional providers for your users to choose from. By default, the Log In page will show the "builtin" provider, but you can adjust this via the ``:DefaultAuthProvider`` configuration option. 

"Remote only" mode should be considered experimental until https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/2974 is resolved. For now, "remote only" means:

- Shibboleth or OAuth has been enabled.
- ``:AllowSignUp`` is set to "false" per the :doc:`config` section to prevent users from creating local accounts via the web interface. Please note that local accounts can also be created via API, and the way to prevent this is to block the ``builtin-users`` endpoint or scramble (or remove) the ``BuiltinUsers.KEY`` database setting per the :doc:`config` section. 
- The "builtin" authentication provider has been disabled. Note that disabling the builting auth provider means that the API endpoint for converting an account from a remote auth provider will not work. This is the main reason why https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/2974 is still open. Converting directly from one remote authentication provider to another (i.e. from GitHub to Google) is not supported. Conversion from remote is always to builtin. Then the user initiates a conversion from builtin to remote. Note that longer term, the plan is to permit multiple login options to the same Dataverse account per https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/3487 (so all this talk of conversion will be moot) but for now users can only use a single login option, as explained in the :doc:`/user/account` section of the User Guide. In short, "remote only" might work for you if you only plan to use a single remote authentication provider such that no conversion between remote authentication providers will be necessary.

File Storage: Local Filesystem vs. Swift
----------------------------------------

By default, a Dataverse installation stores data files (files uploaded by end users) on the filesystem at ``/usr/local/glassfish4/glassfish/domains/domain1/files`` but this path can vary based on answers you gave to the installer (see "Running the Dataverse Installer" under the :doc:`installation-main` section) or afterward by reconfiguring the ``dataverse.files.directory`` JVM option described below.

Alternatively, rather than storing data files on the filesystem, you can opt for a experimental setup with a `Swift Object Storage <http://swift.openstack.org>`_ backend. Each dataset users create gets a corresponding "container" on the Swift side and each data file is saved as a file within that container.

In order to configure a Swift installation, there are two steps you need to complete:

First, create a file named ``swift.properties`` as follows in the ``config`` directory for your installation of Glassfish (by default, this would be ``/usr/local/glassfish4/glassfish/domains/domain1/config/swift.properties``):

.. code-block:: none

    swift.default.endpoint=endpoint1
    swift.auth_type.endpoint1=your-authentication-type
    swift.auth_url.endpoint1=your-auth-url
    swift.tenant.endpoint1=your-tenant-name
    swift.username.endpoint1=your-username
    swift.password.endpoint1=your-password
    swift.swift_endpoint.endpoint1=your-swift-endpoint

``auth_type`` can either be ``keystone`` or it will assumed to be ``basic``. ``auth_url`` should be your keystone authentication URL which includes the tokens (e.g. ``https://openstack.example.edu:35357/v2.0/tokens``). ``swift_endpoint`` is a URL that look something like ``http://rdgw.swift.example.org/swift/v1``.

Second, update the JVM option ``dataverse.files.storage-driver-id`` by running the delete command:

``./asadmin $ASADMIN_OPTS delete-jvm-options "\-Ddataverse.files.storage-driver-id=file"``

Then run the create command:

``./asadmin $ASADMIN_OPTS create-jvm-options "\-Ddataverse.files.storage-driver-id=swift"``

Going Live: Launching Your Production Deployment
------------------------------------------------

This guide has attempted to take you from kicking the tires on Dataverse to finalizing your installation before letting real users in. In theory, all this work could be done on a single server but better would be to have separate staging and production environments so that you can deploy upgrades to staging before deploying to production. This "Going Live" section is about launching your **production** environment.

Before going live with your installation of Dataverse, you must take the steps above under "Securing Your Installation" and you should at least review the various configuration options listed below. An attempt has been made to put the more commonly-configured options earlier in the list.

Out of the box, Dataverse attempts to block search engines from crawling your installation of Dataverse so that test datasets do not appear in search results until you're ready.

Letting Search Engines Crawl Your Installation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For a public production Dataverse installation, it is probably desired that search agents be able to index published pages (aka - pages that are visible to an unauthenticated user).
Polite crawlers usually respect the `Robots Exclusion Standard <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard>`_; we have provided an example of a production robots.txt :download:`here </_static/util/robots.txt>`).

You have a couple of options for putting an updated robots.txt file into production. If you are fronting Glassfish with Apache as recommended above, you can place robots.txt in the root of the directory specified in your ``VirtualHost`` and to your Apache config a ``ProxyPassMatch`` line like the one below to prevent Glassfish from serving the version of robots.txt that embedded in the Dataverse war file:

.. code-block:: text

    # don't let Glassfish serve its version of robots.txt
    ProxyPassMatch ^/robots.txt$ !

For more of an explanation of ``ProxyPassMatch`` see the :doc:`shibboleth` section.

If you are not fronting Glassfish with Apache you'll need to prevent Glassfish from serving the robots.txt file embedded in the war file by overwriting robots.txt after the war file has been deployed. The downside of this technique is that you will have to remember to overwrite robots.txt in the "exploded" war file each time you deploy the war file, which probably means each time you upgrade to a new version of Dataverse. Furthermore, since the version of Dataverse is always incrementing and the version can be part of the file path, you will need to be conscious of where on disk you need to replace the file. For example, for Dataverse 4.6.1 the path to robots.txt may be ``/usr/local/glassfish4/glassfish/domains/domain1/applications/dataverse-4.6.1/robots.txt`` with the version number ``4.6.1`` as part of the path.

Putting Your Dataverse Installation on the Map at dataverse.org
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Congratulations! You've gone live! It's time to announce your new data respository to the world! You are also welcome to contact support@dataverse.org to have the Dataverse team add your installation to the map at http://dataverse.org . Thank you for installing Datavese!

Administration of Your Dataverse Installation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now that you're live you'll want to review the :doc:`/admin/index`. Please note that there is also an :doc:`administration` section of this Installation Guide that will be moved to the newer Admin Guide in the future.

JVM Options
-----------

JVM stands Java Virtual Machine and as a Java application, Glassfish can read JVM options when it is started. A number of JVM options are configured by the installer below is a complete list of the Dataverse-specific JVM options. You can inspect the configured options by running:

``asadmin list-jvm-options | egrep 'dataverse|doi'``

When changing values these values with ``asadmin``, you'll need to delete the old value before adding a new one, like this:

``asadmin delete-jvm-options "-Ddataverse.fqdn=old.example.com"``

``asadmin create-jvm-options "-Ddataverse.fqdn=dataverse.example.com"``

It's also possible to change these values by stopping Glassfish, editing ``glassfish4/glassfish/domains/domain1/config/domain.xml``, and restarting Glassfish.

dataverse.fqdn
++++++++++++++

If the Dataverse server has multiple DNS names, this option specifies the one to be used as the "official" host name. For example, you may want to have dataverse.foobar.edu, and not the less appealling server-123.socsci.foobar.edu to appear exclusively in all the registered global identifiers, Data Deposit API records, etc.

The password reset feature requires ``dataverse.fqdn`` to be configured.

| Do note that whenever the system needs to form a service URL, by default, it will be formed with ``https://`` and port 443. I.e.,
| ``https://{dataverse.fqdn}/``
| If that does not suit your setup, you can define an additional option, ``dataverse.siteUrl``, explained below.

dataverse.siteUrl
+++++++++++++++++

| and specify the protocol and port number you would prefer to be used to advertise the URL for your Dataverse.
| For example, configured in domain.xml:
| ``<jvm-options>-Ddataverse.fqdn=dataverse.foobar.edu</jvm-options>``
| ``<jvm-options>-Ddataverse.siteUrl=http://${dataverse.fqdn}:8080</jvm-options>``

dataverse.files.directory
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is how you configure the path to which files uploaded by users are stored.

dataverse.auth.password-reset-timeout-in-minutes
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Users have 60 minutes to change their passwords by default. You can adjust this value here.

dataverse.rserve.host
+++++++++++++++++++++

Configuration for :doc:`r-rapache-tworavens`.

dataverse.rserve.port
+++++++++++++++++++++

Configuration for :doc:`r-rapache-tworavens`.

dataverse.rserve.user
+++++++++++++++++++++

Configuration for :doc:`r-rapache-tworavens`.

dataverse.rserve.tempdir
++++++++++++++++++++++++
Configuration for :doc:`r-rapache-tworavens`.

dataverse.rserve.password
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Configuration for :doc:`r-rapache-tworavens`.

dataverse.dropbox.key
+++++++++++++++++++++

Dropbox integration is optional. Enter your key here.

dataverse.path.imagemagick.convert
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For overriding the default path to the ``convert`` binary from ImageMagick (``/usr/bin/convert``).

dataverse.dataAccess.thumbnail.image.limit
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For limiting the size (in bytes) of thumbnail images generated from files.

dataverse.dataAccess.thumbnail.pdf.limit
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For limiting the size (in bytes) of thumbnail images generated from files.

.. _doi.baseurlstring:

doi.baseurlstring
+++++++++++++++++

As of this writing "https://ezid.cdlib.org" and "https://mds.datacite.org" are the only valid values. See also these related database settings below:

- :DoiProvider
- :Protocol
- :Authority
- :DoiSeparator

.. _doi.username:

doi.username
++++++++++++

Used in conjuction with ``doi.baseurlstring``.

.. _doi.password:

doi.password
++++++++++++

Used in conjuction with ``doi.baseurlstring``.

dataverse.handlenet.admcredfile
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For Handle support (not fully developed).

dataverse.handlenet.admprivphrase
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
For Handle support (not fully developed).

Database Settings
-----------------

These settings are stored in the ``setting`` table but can be read and modified via the "admin" endpoint of the :doc:`/api/native-api` for easy scripting.

The most commonly used configuration options are listed first.

:BlockedApiPolicy
+++++++++++++++++

Out of the box, all API endpoints are completely open as mentioned in the section on security above. It is highly recommend that you choose one of the policies below and also configure ``:BlockedApiEndpoints``.

- localhost-only: Allow from localhost.
- unblock-key: Require a key defined in ``:BlockedApiKey``.
- drop: Disallow the blocked endpoints completely.

``curl -X PUT -d localhost-only http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:BlockedApiEndpoints``

:BlockedApiEndpoints
++++++++++++++++++++

A comma separated list of API endpoints to be blocked. For a production installation, "admin" should be blocked (and perhaps "builtin-users" as well), as mentioned in the section on security above:

``curl -X PUT -d "admin,builtin-users" http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:BlockedApiEndpoints``

See the :doc:`/api/index` for a list of API endpoints.

:BlockedApiKey
++++++++++++++

Used in conjunction with the ``:BlockedApiPolicy`` being set to ``unblock-key``. When calling blocked APIs, add a query parameter of ``unblock-key=theKeyYouChose`` to use the key.

``curl -X PUT -d s3kretKey http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:BlockedApiKey``

BuiltinUsers.KEY
++++++++++++++++

The key required to create users via API as documented at :doc:`/api/native-api`. Unlike other database settings, this one doesn't start with a colon.

``curl -X PUT -d builtInS3kretKey http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/BuiltinUsers.KEY``

:SystemEmail
++++++++++++

This is the email address that "system" emails are sent from such as password reset links.

``curl -X PUT -d "Support <support@example.edu>" http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:SystemEmail``

:FooterCopyright
++++++++++++++++

By default the footer says "Copyright Â© [YYYY]" but you can add text after the year, as in the example below.

``curl -X PUT -d ", The President &#38; Fellows of Harvard College" http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:FooterCopyright``

.. _:DoiProvider:

:DoiProvider
++++++++++++

As of this writing "EZID" and "DataCite" are the only valid options.

``curl -X PUT -d EZID http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:DoiProvider``

.. _:Protocol:

:Protocol
+++++++++

As of this writing "doi" is the only valid option for the protocol for a persistent ID.

``curl -X PUT -d doi http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:Protocol``

.. _:Authority:

:Authority
++++++++++

Use the DOI authority assigned to you by your DoiProvider.

``curl -X PUT -d 10.xxxx http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:Authority``

.. _:DoiSeparator:

:DoiSeparator
+++++++++++++

It is recommended that you keep this as a slash ("/").

``curl -X PUT -d "/" http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:DoiSeparator``

.. _:IdentifierGenerationStyle:

:IdentifierGenerationStyle
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

By default, Dataverse generates a random 6 character string to use as the identifier
for a Dataset. Set this to "``sequentialNumber``" to use sequential numeric values 
instead. (the assumed default setting is "``randomString``"). 
In addition to this setting, a database sequence must be created in the database. 
We provide the script below (downloadable :download:`here </_static/util/createsequence.sql>`).
You may need to make some changes to suit your system setup, see the comments for more information: 

.. literalinclude:: ../_static/util/createsequence.sql

Note that the SQL above is Postgres-specific. If necessary, it can be reimplemented 
in any other SQL flavor - the standard JPA code in the application simply expects 
the database to have a saved function ("stored procedure") named ``generateIdentifierAsSequentialNumber``
with the single return argument ``identifier``. 

For systems using Postgresql 8.4 or older, the procedural language `plpgsql` should be enabled first.
We have provided an example :download:`here </_static/util/pg8-createsequence-prep.sql>`.


:ApplicationTermsOfUse
++++++++++++++++++++++

Upload an HTML file containing the Terms of Use to be displayed at sign up. Supported HTML tags are listed under the :doc:`/user/dataset-management` section of the User Guide.

``curl -X PUT -d@/tmp/apptou.html http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:ApplicationTermsOfUse``

Unfortunately, in most cases, the text file will probably be too big to upload (>1024 characters) due to a bug. A workaround has been posted to https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/2669

:ApplicationPrivacyPolicyUrl
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Specify a URL where users can read your Privacy Policy, linked from the bottom of the page.

``curl -X PUT -d http://best-practices.dataverse.org/harvard-policies/harvard-privacy-policy.html http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:ApplicationPrivacyPolicyUrl``

:ApiTermsOfUse
++++++++++++++

Specify a URL where users can read your API Terms of Use.

``curl -X PUT -d http://best-practices.dataverse.org/harvard-policies/harvard-api-tou.html http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:ApiTermsOfUse``

:ExcludeEmailFromExport
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Set ``:ExcludeEmailFromExport`` to prevent email addresses for dataset contacts from being exposed in XML or JSON representations of dataset metadata. For a list exported formats such as DDI, see the :doc:`/admin/metadataexport` section of the Admin Guide.

``curl -X PUT -d true http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:ExcludeEmailFromExport``

:GuidesBaseUrl
++++++++++++++

Set ``GuidesBaseUrl`` to override the default value "http://guides.dataverse.org". If you are interested in writing your own version of the guides, you may find the :doc:`/developers/documentation` section of the Developer Guide helpful.

``curl -X PUT -d http://dataverse.example.edu http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:GuidesBaseUrl``

:GuidesVersion
++++++++++++++

Set ``:GuidesVersion`` to override the version number in the URL of guides. For example, rather than http://guides.dataverse.org/en/4.6/user/account.html the version is overriden to http://guides.dataverse.org/en/1234-new-feature/user/account.html in the example below:

``curl -X PUT -d 1234-new-feature http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:GuidesVersion``

:MetricsUrl
+++++++++++

Make the metrics component on the root dataverse a clickable link to a website where you present metrics on your Dataverse installation. This could perhaps be an installation of https://github.com/IQSS/miniverse or any site.

``curl -X PUT -d http://metrics.dataverse.example.edu http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:MetricsUrl``

:StatusMessageHeader
++++++++++++++++++++

For dynamically adding information to the top of every page. For example, "For testing only..." at the top of https://demo.dataverse.org is set with this:

``curl -X PUT -d "For testing only..." http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:StatusMessageHeader``

:MaxFileUploadSizeInBytes
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Set `MaxFileUploadSizeInBytes` to "2147483648", for example, to limit the size of files uploaded to 2 GB.
Notes:
- For SWORD, this size is limited by the Java Integer.MAX_VALUE of 2,147,483,647. (see: https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/2169)
- If the MaxFileUploadSizeInBytes is NOT set, uploads, including SWORD may be of unlimited size.

``curl -X PUT -d 2147483648 http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:MaxFileUploadSizeInBytes``

:TabularIngestSizeLimit
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Threshold in bytes for limiting whether or not "ingest" it attempted for tabular files (which can be resource intensive). For example, with the below in place, files greater than 2 GB in size will not go through the ingest process:

``curl -X PUT -d 2000000000 http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:TabularIngestSizeLimit``

(You can set this value to 0 to prevent files from being ingested at all.)

You can overide this global setting on a per-format basis for the following formats:

- dta
- por
- sav
- Rdata
- CSV
- xlsx

For example, if you want your installation of Dataverse to not attempt to ingest Rdata files larger that 1 MB, use this setting:

``curl -X PUT -d 1000000 http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:TabularIngestSizeLimit:Rdata``

:ZipUploadFilesLimit
++++++++++++++++++++

Limit the number of files in a zip that Dataverse will accept.

:GoogleAnalyticsCode
++++++++++++++++++++

Set your Google Analytics Tracking ID thusly:

``curl -X PUT -d 'trackingID' http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:GoogleAnalyticsCode``

:SolrHostColonPort
++++++++++++++++++

By default Dataverse will attempt to connect to Solr on port 8983 on localhost. Use this setting to change the hostname or port. You must restart Glassfish after making this change.

``curl -X PUT -d localhost:8983 http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:SolrHostColonPort``

:SignUpUrl
++++++++++

The relative path URL to which users will be sent after signup. The default setting is below.

``curl -X PUT -d '/dataverseuser.xhtml?editMode=CREATE' http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:SignUpUrl``

:TwoRavensUrl
+++++++++++++

The location of your TwoRavens installation.  Activation of TwoRavens also requires the setting below, ``TwoRavensTabularView``

:TwoRavensTabularView
+++++++++++++++++++++

Set ``TwoRavensTabularView`` to true to allow a user to view tabular files via the TwoRavens application. This boolean affects whether a user will see the "Explore" button.

``curl -X PUT -d true http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:TwoRavensTabularView``

:GeoconnectCreateEditMaps
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Set ``GeoconnectCreateEditMaps`` to true to allow the user to create GeoConnect Maps. This boolean effects whether the user sees the map button on the dataset page and if the ingest will create a shape file.

``curl -X PUT -d true http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:GeoconnectCreateEditMaps``

:GeoconnectViewMaps
+++++++++++++++++++

Set ``GeoconnectViewMaps`` to true to allow a user to view existing maps. This boolean effects whether a user will see the "Explore" button.

``curl -X PUT -d true http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:GeoconnectViewMaps``

:GeoconnectDebug
+++++++++++++++++++

For Development only.  Set ``GeoconnectDebug`` to true to allow a user to see SQL that can be used to insert mock map data into the database.

``curl -X PUT -d true http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:GeoconnectDebug``

:DatasetPublishPopupCustomText
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Set custom text a user will view when publishing a dataset. Note that this text is exposed via the "Info" endpoint of the :doc:`/api/native-api`.

``curl -X PUT -d "Deposit License Requirements" http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:DatasetPublishPopupCustomText``

:DatasetPublishPopupCustomTextOnAllVersions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Set whether a user will see the custom text when publishing all versions of a dataset

``curl -X PUT -d true http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:DatasetPublishPopupCustomTextOnAllVersions``

:SearchHighlightFragmentSize
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Set ``SearchHighlightFragmentSize`` to override the default value of 100 from https://wiki.apache.org/solr/HighlightingParameters#hl.fragsize . In practice, a value of "320" seemed to fix the issue at https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/2191

``curl -X PUT -d 320 http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:SearchHighlightFragmentSize``

:ScrubMigrationData
+++++++++++++++++++

Allow for migration of non-conformant data (especially dates) from DVN 3.x to Dataverse 4.

:MinutesUntilConfirmEmailTokenExpires
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The duration in minutes before "Confirm Email" URLs expire. The default is 1440 minutes (24 hours).  See also :doc:`/installation/administration`.

:DefaultAuthProvider
++++++++++++++++++++

If you have enabled Shibboleth and/or one or more OAuth providers, you may wish to make one of these authentication providers the default when users visit the Log In page. If unset, this will default to ``builtin`` but thes valid options (depending if you've done the setup described in the :doc:`shibboleth` or :doc:`oauth2` sections) are:

- ``builtin``
- ``shib``
- ``orcid``
- ``github``
- ``google``

Here is an example of setting the default auth provider back to ``builtin``:

``curl -X PUT -d builtin http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:DefaultAuthProvider``

:AllowSignUp
++++++++++++

Set to false to disallow local accounts to be created. See also the sections on :doc:`shibboleth` and :doc:`oauth2`.

:PiwikAnalyticsId
++++++++++++++++++++

Site identifier created in your Piwik instance. Example:

``curl -X PUT -d 42 http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:PiwikAnalyticsId``

:PiwikAnalyticsHost
++++++++++++++++++++

Host FQDN or URL of your Piwik instance before the ``/piwik.php``. Examples:

``curl -X PUT -d stats.domain.tld http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:PiwikAnalyticsHost``

or

``curl -X PUT -d hostname.domain.tld/stats http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:PiwikAnalyticsHost``

:FileFixityChecksumAlgorithm
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Dataverse calculates checksums for uploaded files so that users can determine if their file was corrupted via upload or download. This is sometimes called "file fixity": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Fixity

The default checksum algorithm used is MD5 and should be sufficient for establishing file fixity. "SHA-1" is an experimental alternate value for this setting.

:ShibPassiveLoginEnabled
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Set ``:ShibPassiveLoginEnabled`` to true to enable passive login for Shibboleth. When this feature is enabled, an additional Javascript file (isPassive.js) will be loaded for every page. It will generate a passive login request to your Shibboleth SP when an anonymous user navigates to the site. A cookie named "_check_is_passive_dv" will be created to keep track of whether or not a passive login request has already been made for the user.

This implementation follows the example on the Shibboleth wiki documentation page for the isPassive feature: https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/SHIB2/isPassive

It is recommended that you configure additional error handling for your Service Provider if you enable passive login. A good way of doing this is described in the Shibboleth wiki documentation:

- *In your Service Provider 2.x shibboleth2.xml file, add redirectErrors="#THIS PAGE#" to the Errors element.*

You can set the value of "#THIS PAGE#" to the url of your Dataverse homepage, or any other page on your site that is accessible to anonymous users and will have the isPassive.js file loaded.

``curl -X PUT -d true http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:ShibPassiveLoginEnabled``
