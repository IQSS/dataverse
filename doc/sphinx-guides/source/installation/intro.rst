============
Introduction
============

Welcome! Thanks for installing `Dataverse <http://dataverse.org>`_!

Quick Links
-----------

If you are installing Dataverse for the first time, please proceed to the :doc:`prep` section.

Jump ahead to :doc:`config` or :doc:`upgrading` for an existing Dataverse installation.

Intended Audience
-----------------

This guide is intended primarily for sysadmins who are installing, configuring, and upgrading Dataverse. 

Sysadmins are expected to be comfortable using standard Linux commands, issuing ``curl`` commands, and running SQL scripts.

Related Guides
--------------

Many "admin" functions can be performed by Dataverse users themselves (non-superusers) as documented in the :doc:`/user/index` and that guide is a good introduction to the features of Dataverse from an end user perspective.

If you are a sysadmin who likes to code, you may find the :doc:`/api/index` useful, and you may want to consider improving the installation script or hacking on the community-lead configuration management options mentioned in the :doc:`prep` section. If you **really** like to code and want to help with the Dataverse code, please check out the :doc:`/developers/index`!
