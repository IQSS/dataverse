Tool	Type	Scope	Description
Data Explorer	explore	file	"A GUI which lists the variables in a tabular data file allowing searching, charting and cross tabulation analysis. See the README.md file at https://github.com/scholarsportal/dataverse-data-explorer-v2 for the instructions on adding Data Explorer to your Dataverse."
Whole Tale	explore	dataset	"A platform for the creation of reproducible research packages that allows users to launch containerized interactive analysis environments based on popular tools such as Jupyter and RStudio. Using this integration, Dataverse users can launch Jupyter and RStudio environments to analyze published datasets. For more information, see the `Whole Tale User Guide <https://wholetale.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users_guide/integration.html>`_."
Binder	explore	dataset	Binder allows you to spin up custom computing environments in the cloud (including Jupyter notebooks) with the files from your dataset. See https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-binder-redirect for installation instructions.
File Previewers	explore	file	"A set of tools that display the content of files - including audio, html, `Hypothes.is <https://hypothes.is/>`_ annotations, images, PDF, Markdown, text, video, tabular data, spreadsheets, GeoJSON, zip, and NcML files - allowing them to be viewed without downloading the file. The previewers can be run directly from github.io, so the only required step is using the Dataverse API to register the ones you want to use. Documentation, including how to optionally brand the previewers, and an invitation to contribute through github are in the README.md file. Initial development was led by the Qualitative Data Repository and the spreasdheet previewer was added by the Social Sciences and Humanities Open Cloud (SSHOC) project. https://github.com/gdcc/dataverse-previewers"
Data Curation Tool	configure	file	"A GUI for curating data by adding labels, groups, weights and other details to assist with informed reuse. See the README.md file at https://github.com/scholarsportal/Dataverse-Data-Curation-Tool for the installation instructions."
Ask the Data	query	file	Ask the Data is an experimental tool that allows you ask natural language questions about the data contained in Dataverse tables (tabular data). See the README.md file at https://github.com/IQSS/askdataverse/tree/main/askthedata for the instructions on adding Ask the Data to your Dataverse installation. 
TurboCurator by ICPSR	configure	dataset	TurboCurator generates metadata improvements for title, description, and keywords. It relies on open AI's ChatGPT & ICPSR best practices. See the `TurboCurator Dataverse Administrator <https://turbocurator.icpsr.umich.edu/tc/adminabout/>`_ page for more details on how it works and adding TurboCurator to your Dataverse installation.
JupyterHub	explore	file	The `Dataverse-to-JupyterHub Data Transfer Connector <https://forgemia.inra.fr/dipso/eosc-pillar/dataverse-jupyterhub-connector>`_ is a tool that simplifies the transfer of data between Dataverse repositories and the cloud-based platform JupyterHub. It is designed for researchers, scientists, and data analysts, facilitating collaboration on projects by seamlessly moving datasets and files. The tool is a lightweight client-side web application built using React and relies on the Dataverse External Tool feature, allowing for easy deployment on modern integration systems. Currently optimized for small to medium-sized files, future plans include extending support for larger files and signed Dataverse endpoints. For more details, you can refer to the external tool manifest: https://forgemia.inra.fr/dipso/eosc-pillar/dataverse-jupyterhub-connector/-/blob/master/externalTools.json
