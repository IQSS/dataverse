Tool	Type	Scope	Description
Data Explorer	explore	file	"A GUI which lists the variables in a tabular data file allowing searching, charting and cross tabulation analysis. See the README.md file at https://github.com/scholarsportal/dataverse-data-explorer-v2 for the instructions on adding Data Explorer to your Dataverse."
Whole Tale	explore	dataset	"A platform for the creation of reproducible research packages that allows users to launch containerized interactive analysis environments based on popular tools such as Jupyter and RStudio. Using this integration, Dataverse users can launch Jupyter and RStudio environments to analyze published datasets. For more information, see the `Whole Tale User Guide <https://wholetale.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users_guide/integration.html>`_."
Binder	explore	dataset	Binder allows you to spin up custom computing environments in the cloud (including Jupyter notebooks) with the files from your dataset. `Installation instructions <https://github.com/data-exp-lab/girder_ythub/issues/10>`_ are in the Data Exploration Lab girder_ythub project.
File Previewers	explore	file	"A set of tools that display the content of files - including audio, html, `Hypothes.is <https://hypothes.is/>`_ annotations, images, PDF, text, video, tabular data, spreadsheets, GeoJSON, zip, and NcML files - allowing them to be viewed without downloading the file. The previewers can be run directly from github.io, so the only required step is using the Dataverse API to register the ones you want to use. Documentation, including how to optionally brand the previewers, and an invitation to contribute through github are in the README.md file. Initial development was led by the Qualitative Data Repository and the spreasdheet previewer was added by the Social Sciences and Humanities Open Cloud (SSHOC) project. https://github.com/gdcc/dataverse-previewers"
Data Curation Tool	configure	file	"A GUI for curating data by adding labels, groups, weights and other details to assist with informed reuse. See the README.md file at https://github.com/scholarsportal/Dataverse-Data-Curation-Tool for the installation instructions."
Ask the Data	query	file	Ask the Data is an experimental tool that allows you ask natural language questions about the data contained in Dataverse tables (tabular data). See the README.md file at https://github.com/IQSS/askdataverse/tree/main/askthedata for the instructions on adding Ask the Data to your Dataverse installation.
