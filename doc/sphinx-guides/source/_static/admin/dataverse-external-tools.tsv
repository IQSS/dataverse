Whole Tale	explore	dataset	A platform for the creation of reproducible research packages that allows users to launch containerized interactive analysis environments based on popular tools such as Jupyter and RStudio. Using this integration, Dataverse users can launch Jupyter and RStudio environments to analyze published datasets. For more information, see the `Whole Tale User Guide <https://wholetale.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users_guide/integration.html>`_.
File Previewers	explore	file	A set of tools that display the content of files - including audio, html, `Hypothes.is <https://hypothes.is/>`_ annotations, images, PDF, text, video, tabular data, and spreadsheets - allowing them to be viewed without downloading. The previewers can be run directly from github.io, so the only required step is using the Dataverse API to register the ones you want to use. Documentation, including how to optionally brand the previewers, and an invitation to contribute through github are in the README.md file. Initial development was led by the Qualitative Data Repository and the spreasdheet previewer was added by the Social Sciences and Humanities Open Cloud (SSHOC) project. https://github.com/GlobalDataverseCommunityConsortium/dataverse-previewers
