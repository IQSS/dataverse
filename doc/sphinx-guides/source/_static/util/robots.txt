User-agent: *
# Note: In its current form, this sample robots.txt makes the site
# accessible to all the crawler bots (specified as "User-agent: *")
# It further instructs the bots to access and index the dataverse and dataset pages;
# it also tells them to stay away from all other pages (the "Disallow: /" line); 
# and also not to follow any search links on a dataverse page. 
# It is possible to specify different access rules for different bots. 
# For example, if you only want to make the site accessed by Googlebot, but 
# keep all the other bots away, un-comment out the following two lines:
#Disallow: /
#User-agent: Googlebot
Allow: /$
Allow: /dataset.xhtml
Allow: /dataverse/
Allow: /sitemap/
# Comment out the following TWO lines if you DON'T MIND the bots crawling the search API links on dataverse pages:
Disallow: /dataverse/*?q
Disallow: /dataverse/*/search
Disallow: /
# Crawl-delay specification *may* be honored by *some* bots. 
# It is *definitely* ignored by Googlebot (they never promise to 
# recognize it either - it's never mentioned in their documentation)
Crawl-delay: 20
