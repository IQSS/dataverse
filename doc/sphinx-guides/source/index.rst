How the Guides Are Organized
=============================

The Guides are reference documents that explain how to use Dataverse,
which are divided into the following sections: Getting Started, User Guide,
Installation Guide, Developers Guide, and API Guide. The User Guide is further divided into primary activities: finding & using
data, adding Datasets, administering dataverses or Datasets, and Dataset exploration/visualizations. Details
on all of the above tasks can be found in the Users Guide. The
Installation Guide is for people or organizations who want to host their
own Dataverse. The Developers Guide contains instructions for
people who want to contribute to the Open Source Dataverse
project or who want to modify the code to suit their own needs. Finally, the API Guide is for
Developers that work on other applications and are interested in connecting with Dataverse through our APIs.
