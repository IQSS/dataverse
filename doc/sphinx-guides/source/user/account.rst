Account Information
-------------------

As a registered user, you can:

-  Create your own dataverse and customize it
-  Add datasets to dataverses, if available
-  Contribute to existing datasets, if available
-  Request access to restricted files, if available

Account Log In Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dataverse has been configured for one or more of the following log in options:

- Username/Email and Password
- Institutional Log In
- ORCID
- GitHub
- Google

Please note that once you create your Dataverse account, it will be associated with only one of the log in options above.

The Institutional Log In, ORCID, GitHub, and Google options are described in more detail below under "Remote Authentication."

Create Account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a Dataverse account with the Username/Email log in option, use the "Sign Up" page, fill out the fields, then click the Create Account button. Please note that the Username field does not support email addresses but will allow the following characters: a-Z, 0-9, _ (underscores), - (hyphens), and . (periods).

To create a Dataverse account associated with the log in option for your institution, ORCID, GitHub, or Google, use the "Log In" page and select one of these authentication providers. See the "Remote Authentication" section below for details.

Edit Account 
~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. To edit your account after you have logged in, click on your account name in the header on the right hand side and click on Account Information.
#. On the top right of your account page, click on the "Edit Account" button and from there you can select to edit either your Account Information or your Account Password.
#. Select "Save Changes" when you are done.

Please note that you cannot edit your account information within Dataverse if you use the Institutional Log In option. Instead, you should contact your institution to change your name, email, etc. Once the change is made by your institution, it will be reflected in Dataverse the next time you log in. Users of the Institutional Log In option are not required to verify their email address because the institution providing the email address is trusted.

Convert Account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If more than one log in option is available, you can convert from one to another and use the new option from now on.

If you are converting from the Email/Username log in option you will need to have your password ready to complete the conversion process. Click Log In, select the new log in option, and go through the log in process. When you return to Dataverse, look for an option allowing you to convert and enter your password to complete the conversion. The section on Remote Authentication below has more specific information on converting to Institutional Log In, ORCID, GitHub, and Google.

If you need to perform any other conversion (i.e. from Google to GitHub), use the Support link at the top of the page for assistance.

Reset Account Password
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Only Dataverse accounts using the Username/Email log in option have an associated password stored (securely!) in Dataverse. If you cannot remember this password, click on Log In in the top right corner of any page and click the "Forgot Password?" link below where you would enter your username/email and password. Enter your email address and click "Submit Password Request" to receive an email with a link to reset your password.

Please note that if you have forgotten your username, you can use this same process to receive your username in an email.

Remote Authentication
---------------------

Too many passwords? By using your log in credentials from a remote authentication provider, you won't have an extra password to remember for your Dataverse account.

Institutional Log In
