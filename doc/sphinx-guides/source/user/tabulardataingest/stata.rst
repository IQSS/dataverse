Stata

	:local:

Of all the third party statistical software providers, Stata does the best job at documenting the internal format of their files, by far. And at making that documentation freely and easily available to developers (yes, we are looking at you, SPSS). Because of that, Stata is the best supported format for tabular data ingest.  


**New in Dataverse 4.0:** support for Stata v.13 has been added.
