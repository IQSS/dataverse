Getting Started Guide
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Steps for Researchers
========================

#. Prepare your data ahead of time with all the necessary files (preferably open formats or formats widely used within your community): data, code, documentation and descriptive metadata that would help make your research data discoverable, reusable and if possible replicable for other researchers.
#. Go to `dataverse.org <http://dataverse.org>`_
#. Select a Dataverse repository that you can deposit your Dataset into (e.g. Harvard Dataverse is open for all researchers worldwide from all disciplines).
#. Sign-up for an Account.
#. Create or select an existing Dataverse to add your data to.
#. Create a Dataset (in 3.6 this is called a Study).
#. Describe the Dataset to receive a formal data citation (w/ persistent DOI URL) for others to discover and cite your work.
#. Upload Data + Code + Documentation. We support any format or number of files, with more features for some formats (e.g., R, SPSS, Stata, FITS, CSV, xslx).
#. Publish your Dataset (in 3.6 this is Release your Study) for others to find, cite, reuse and reproduce analyses of your research.

Steps for Journals
============================

As a journal you have two options: 

**Option 1:** 
Recommend that your authors deposit data in one of the repositories on `dataverse.org <http://dataverse.org>`_

**Option 2:** 
If you would like to be able to organize, review and approve all datasets that are associated with your published journal articles then you can setup your own Journal Dataverse by following the steps below:

For Option 2:
------------------

#. Go to `dataverse.org <http://dataverse.org>`_.
#. Select a Dataverse repository that you want to setup your Journal Dataverse in for your authors to deposit their Datasets into (e.g. Harvard Dataverse is open for all researchers worldwide from all disciplines).
#. Sign-up for an Account.
#. Create a Dataverse
#. Give permission to any Dataverse to submit data for review to your Dataverse.
#. Publish your Dataverse (in 3.6 this is Release your Dataverse).
#. Add a link on your journal website pointing to your new Dataverse.
#. You will receive an email notification when an author submits a Dataset to your Dataverse, so that you can go and in and review the data.
#. If you are happy with the Dataset you can Publish the Dataset (in 3.6 this is Release the Study). The author will receive an email notification when their Dataset is published in your Dataverse.
#. Include the Data Citation with the persistent DOI as a reference in your corresponding journal article.
