A new metadata export format called Croissant is now available as an external metadata exporter. It is oriented toward making datasets consumable by machine learning.

When enabled, Croissant replaces the Schema.org JSON-LD format in the `<head>` of dataset landing pages. For details, see the [Schema.org JSON-LD/Croissant Metadata](https://dataverse-guide--10533.org.readthedocs.build/en/10533/admin/discoverability.html#schema-org-head) under the discoverability section of the Admin Guide.

For more about the Croissant exporter, see https://github.com/gdcc/exporter-croissant

For installation instructions, see [Enabling External Exporters](https://dataverse-guide--10533.org.readthedocs.build/en/10533/installation/advanced.html#enabling-external-exporters) in the Installation Guide.
