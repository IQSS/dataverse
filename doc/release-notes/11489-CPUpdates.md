Not sure what is already in the notes w.r.t. counter-processor updates (separate repo) so I'll try to be ~complete here

### Make Data Count improvements

Counter-processor, used to power Make Data Count metrics in Dataverse is now maintained in the https://github.com/gdcc/counter-processor repository. Multiple improvements to efficiency and scalability have been made. The example counter_daily.sh and counter_weekly.sh scripts that automate using counter-processor, available from the MDC section of the Dataverse Guides (https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/admin/make-data-count.html) have been updated to work with the latest counter-processor release and also have minor improvements.
