It is now possible to export metadata before a dataset is published.

Note that the export format placed in the `<head>` of the dataset landing page continues to show only the latest published version, as before. See [the guides](https://preview.guides.gdcc.io/en/develop/admin/discoverability.html#schema-org-json-ld-croissant-metadata) for more on this feature.

See #11305.
