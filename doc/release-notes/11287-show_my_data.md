### Backward Incompatibilities

An undocumented Search API parameter called "show_my_data" has been removed. It was never exercised by tests and is believed to be unused. API users should use the [MyData] API instead. See the [API changelog](https://dataverse-guide--11375.org.readthedocs.build/en/11375/api/changelog.html), #11287 and #11375.
