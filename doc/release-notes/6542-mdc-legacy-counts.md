###For installations using MDC (Make Data Count), it is now possible to display both the MDC metrics and the legacy access counts, generated before MDC was enabled.

This is enabled via the new setting `:MDCStartDate` that specifies the cutoff date. If a dataset has any legacy access counts collected prior to that date, those numbers will be displayed in addition to the any MDC numbers recorded since then.
