### Dataset Metadata Can Be Exported From Draft Datasets (via API)

In previous versions of Dataverse, it was only possible to export metadata from published datasets. It is now possible to export metadata from draft datasets via API as long as you supply an API token that has access to the draft. As before, when exporting metadata from published datasets, only the latest published version is supported. See [the guides](https://dataverse-guide--11398.org.readthedocs.build/en/11398/api/native-api.html#export-metadata-of-a-dataset-in-various-formats), #11305, and #11398.
