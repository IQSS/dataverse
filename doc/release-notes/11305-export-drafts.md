### Dataset Metadata Can Be Exported From Draft Datasets

In previous versions of Dataverse, it was only possible to export metadata from published datasets. Drafts are now supported as well when you supply an API token with access. As before, when exporting metadata from published datasets, only the latest published version is supported. See [the guides](https://dataverse-guide--11398.org.readthedocs.build/en/11398/api/native-api.html#export-metadata-of-a-dataset-in-various-formats), #11305, and #11398.
