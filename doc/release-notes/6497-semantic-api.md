# Release Highlights

### Dataset Semantic API (Experimental)

Dataset metadata can be retrieved/set/updated using a new, flatter JSON-LD format - following the format of an OAI-ORE export (RDA-conformant Bags), allowing for easier transfer of metadata to/from other systems (i.e. without needing to know Dataverse's metadata block and field storage architecture). This new API also allows for the update of terms metadata (#5899).

This development was supported by the [Research Data Alliance](https://rd-alliance.org), DANS, and Sciences PO and follows the recommendations from the [Research Data Repository Interoperability Working Group](http://dx.doi.org/10.15497/RDA00025).
