It is now possible to write external vocabulary scripts that target a single child field in a metadata block. Example scripts are now available at https://github.com/gdcc/dataverse-external-vocab-support that can be configured to support lookup from the Research Orgnaization Registry (ROR) for the Author Affiliation Field and for the CrossRef Funding Registry (Fundreg) in the Funding Information/Agency field, both in the standard Citation metadata block. Application if these scripts to other fields, and the development of other scripts targetting child fields are now possible.
