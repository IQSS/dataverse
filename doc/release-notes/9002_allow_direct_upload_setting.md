A Dataverse installation can be now be configured to allow out-of-band upload by setting the `dataverse.files.<id>.upload-out-of-band` JVM option to `true`.

By default, Dataverse supports uploading files via the [add a file to a dataset](https://dataverse-guide--9003.org.readthedocs.build/en/9003/api/native-api.html#add-a-file-to-a-dataset) API. With S3 stores, a direct upload process can be enabled to allow sending the file directly to the S3 store (without any intermediate copies on the Dataverse server).

With the upload-out-of-band option enabled, it is also possible for file upload to be managed manually or via third-party tools, with the [Adding the Uploaded file to the Dataset](https://dataverse-guide--9003.org.readthedocs.build/en/9003/developers/s3-direct-upload-api.html#adding-the-uploaded-file-to-the-dataset) API call (described in the [Direct DataFile Upload/Replace API](https://dataverse-guide--9003.org.readthedocs.build/en/9003/developers/s3-direct-upload-api.html) page) used to add metadata and inform Dataverse that a new file has been added to the relevant store.
