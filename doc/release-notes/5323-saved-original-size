Starting the release 4.10 the size of the saved original file (for an
ingested tabular datafile) is stored in the database.  We provided the
following API that retrieve and permanently store the sizes for any
already existing saved originals:
/api/admin/datafiles/integrity/fixmissingoriginalsizes (see the
documentation note in the Native API guide, under "Datafile
Integrity").

While it's not strictly necessary to have these sizes in the database,
having them makes certain operations more efficient (primary example
is a user downloading the saved originals for multiple files/an entire
dataset etc.) Also, if present in the database, the size will be added
to the file information displayed in the output of the /api/datasets;
which can be useful for some users.
