### Search by License

License facet has been added and will be displayed as long as there is more one license in datasets and datafiles the result page. This facet allow you to filter by license.
Also, Search API does handle license filtering using `fq` parameter, for example : `/api/search?q=*&fq=license%3A%22CC0+1.0%22` for CC0 1.0. See PR #10204
