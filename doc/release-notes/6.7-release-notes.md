# Dataverse 6.7

Please note: To read these instructions in full, please go to https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/releases/tag/v6.7 rather than the [list of releases](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/releases), which will cut them off.

This release brings new features, enhancements, and bug fixes to Dataverse. Thank you to all of the community members who contributed code, suggestions, bug reports, and other assistance across the project!

## Release Highlights

Highlights for Dataverse 6.7 include:

- file previewers are now available in the development environment
- licenses may now be linked to Dataset Types
- ability to pin a specific Dataverse version in Docker

## Features Added

### File Previews Available in Dev Environment, More Docs

In Dataverse 6.5 File Previewers were enabled in the "demo or eval" containerized (Dockerized) environment (#11025). These previewers are now available in the development environment as well and [documentation](https://dataverse-guide--11181.org.readthedocs.build/en/11181/container/running/demo.html#file-previewers) has been added explaining how to configure them. See also #10506 and #11181.

### Dataset Types can set available Licenses

Licenses (e.g. "MIT") can now be linked to dataset types (e.g. "software") using new superuser APIs. The create Dataset Type APIs have been extended to allow you to set metadata blocks and/or licenses on the creation of a Dataset Type. 

If a license is not available for a given dataset type then the Create Dataset API will prevent that license from being applied to the dataset.
Also, the UI will only show those licenses that are available to a the dataset's dataset type.

For more information, see the guides ([overview](https://dataverse-guide--11385.org.readthedocs.build/en/11385/user/dataset-management.html#dataset-types), [new APIs](https://dataverse-guide--11385.org.readthedocs.build/en/11385/api/native-api.html#set-available-licenses-for-a-dataset-type)), #10519 and #11001.

### Ability to pin to a specific Dataverse version in Docker (and more)

Container image management has been enhanced to provide better support for multiple Dataverse releases and improved maintenance workflows.

**Versioned Image Tags**: Application ("dataverse") and Config Baker [images on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/gdcc) now have versioned tags, supporting the latest three Dataverse software releases. This enables users to pin to specific versions (e.g. 6.7), providing better stability for production deployments. Previously, the "alpha" tag could be used, but it was always overwritten by the latest release. Now, you can choose the 6.7 tag, for example, to stay on that version. Please note that the "alpha" tag should no longer be used and will likely be deleted. The equivalent is the new "latest" tag.

**Backport Support**: Application and Config Baker image builds now support including code backports for past releases, enabling the delivery of security fixes and critical updates to older (supported) versions.

**Enhanced Documentation**: Container image [documentation](https://dataverse-guide--11477.org.readthedocs.build/en/11477/container/index.html) has been updated to reflect the new versioning scheme and maintenance processes.

**Config Baker Base Image Change**: The Config Baker image has been migrated from Alpine to Ubuntu as its base operating system, aligning with other container images in the project for consistency and better compatibility. The past releases have not been migrated, only future releases (6.7+) will use Ubuntu.

**Workflow Responsibility Split**: GitHub Actions workflows for containers have been reorganized with a clear separation of concerns:

- `container_maintenance.yml` handles all release-time and maintenance activities
- Other workflows focus solely on preview images for development merges and pull requests

These improvements provide more robust container image lifecycle management, better security update delivery, and clearer operational procedures for both development and production environments.
See also the [Container Guide](https://dataverse-guide--11477.org.readthedocs.build/en/11477/container/index.html), #10618, and #11477.

### Notes for documentation writers

Sphinx has been upgraded to 7.4.0 and new dependencies have been added, including semver. Please re-run the `pip install -r requirements.txt` setup [step](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/6.7/contributor/documentation.html#installing-sphinx) to upgrade your environment. Otherwise you might see an error like `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'semver'`.

### Archival Bag Configuration Change

Archival Bags now use the JVM option `dataverse.bagit.sourceorg.name` in generating the bag-info.txt file's "Internal-Sender-Identifier" (in addition to its use for "Source-Organization") rather than pulling the value from a deprecated `bagit.SourceOrganization` entry in Bundle.properties ("Internal-Sender-Identifier" is generated by appending " Catalog" in both cases). Sites using archival bags would not see a change if these settings were already using the same value. See #10680 and #11416.

### String Field Type Added

The "string" type has been added as a new field type for metadata fields.

In contrast to "text" fields, "string" fields are stored and indexed exactly as provided, without any text analysis or transformations.

This field type is suitable for fields like IDs (e.g. ORCIDs) or enums, where exact matches are required when searching.

### Modify Assign Role API error message

Change error message from specifying 'User' and 'Dataverse' since it is used for groups and Datasets as well
Generic message: datasets.api.grant.role.assignee.has.role.error=Role has already been granted.

Note: Re-Translation needed.

### Other Features

- It is now possible to link draft datasets to other Dataverse collections. As usual, the datasets will only become publicly visible in the linked collection(s) after they have been published. To publish a linked dataset, your account must have the "Publish Dataset" permission for the Dataverse collection in which the dataset was originally created. Permissions in the linked Dataverse collections do not apply. See also #10134.
- Navigation across the guides has been improved. You can now click in the upper left to go "home". The navbar has been simplified with fewer links. The bottom of every page now has "Next" and "Previous" links. A "Source" link at the bottom has also been added. See #10942.
- The tutorial on running Dataverse in Docker has been updated to include [how to load a metadata block](https://dataverse-guide--11204.org.readthedocs.build/en/11204/container/running/demo.html#additional-metadata-blocks) and then update Solr to know about the new fields. See also #11004 and #11204




## Bugs Fixed

-Deeply nested compound fields are not (yet) supported by Dataverse but the Search API now properly avoids returning duplicate values for them. See #11172.




## API Updates

### API for Persistent Identifier Reconciliation
Added a new API for persistent identifier reconciliation. An unpublished dataset can be updated with a new
pidProvider. If a persistent identifier was already registered when the dataset was registered, this is undone and the
new provider (if changed in the meantime) is used. Note that this change does not affect the storage repository where the old identifier is still
used. See [the guides](https://dataverse-guide--10567.org.readthedocs.build/en/10567/api/native-api.html#reconcile-the-pid-of-a-dataset-if-multiple-pid-providers-are-enabled), #10501, and #10567.

## Upgrade Instructions

Upgrading requires a maintenance window and downtime. Please plan accordingly, create backups of your database, etc.

These instructions assume that you've already upgraded through all the 5.x releases and are now running Dataverse 6.6.

If you are using archival bags, be sure that the `dataverse.bagit.sourceorg.name` JVM option is set.
