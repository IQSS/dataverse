# Dataverse 6.7

Please note: To read these instructions in full, please go to https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/releases/tag/v6.7 rather than the [list of releases](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/releases), which will cut them off.

This release brings new features, enhancements, and bug fixes to Dataverse. Thank you to all of the community members who contributed code, suggestions, bug reports, and other assistance across the project!

## Release Highlights

Highlights for Dataverse 6.7 include:

- file previewers are now available in the development environment
- licenses may now be linked to Dataset Types

## Features Added

### File Previews Available in Dev Environment, More Docs

In Dataverse 6.5 File Previewers were enabled in the "demo or eval" containerized (Dockerized) environment (#11025). These previewers are now available in the development environment as well and [documentation](https://dataverse-guide--11181.org.readthedocs.build/en/11181/container/running/demo.html#file-previewers) has been added explaining how to configure them. See also #10506 and #11181.

### Dataset Types can set available Licenses

Licenses (e.g. "MIT") can now be linked to dataset types (e.g. "software") using new superuser APIs. The create Dataset Type APIs have been extended to allow you to set metadata blocks and/or licenses on the creation of a Dataset Type. 

If a license is not available for a given dataset type then the Create Dataset API will prevent that license from being applied to the dataset.
Also, the UI will only show those licenses that are available to a the dataset's dataset type.

For more information, see the guides ([overview](https://dataverse-guide--11385.org.readthedocs.build/en/11385/user/dataset-management.html#dataset-types), [new APIs](https://dataverse-guide--11385.org.readthedocs.build/en/11385/api/native-api.html#set-available-licenses-for-a-dataset-type)), #10519 and #11001.




### Other Features

- It is now possible to link draft datasets to other Dataverse collections. As usual, the datasets will only become publicly visible in the linked collection(s) after they have been published. To publish a linked dataset, your account must have the "Publish Dataset" permission for the Dataverse collection in which the dataset was originally created. Permissions in the linked Dataverse collections do not apply. See also #10134.
 



## Bugs Fixed



## API Updates

### API for Persistent Identifier Reconciliation
Added a new API for persistent identifier reconciliation. An unpublished dataset can be updated with a new
pidProvider. If a persistent identifier was already registered when the dataset was registered, this is undone and the
new provider (if changed in the meantime) is used. Note that this change does not affect the storage repository where the old identifier is still
used. See [the guides](https://dataverse-guide--10567.org.readthedocs.build/en/10567/api/native-api.html#reconcile-the-pid-of-a-dataset-if-multiple-pid-providers-are-enabled), #10501, and #10567.
