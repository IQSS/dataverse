- Payara application server has been upgraded to version 6.2025.2. See #11126 and #11128.

## Installation

The following assumes the standard instructions to undeploy v6.5, stop payara, `export PAYARA=/usr/local/payara6`, etc. have been done already.

### Upgrade to Payara 6.2025.2

The steps below reuse your existing domain directory with the new distribution. You may also want to review the Payara upgrade instructions as it could be helpful during any troubleshooting:
[Payara Release Notes](https://docs.payara.fish/community/docs/6.2025.2/Release%20Notes/Release%20Notes%206.2025.2.html).
We also recommend you ensure you followed all update instructions from the past releases regarding Payara.
(The most recent Payara update was for [v6.3](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/releases/tag/v6.3).)

Move the current Payara directory out of the way:

```shell
mv $PAYARA $PAYARA.6.2024.6
```

Download the new Payara version 6.2025.2 (from https://www.payara.fish/downloads/payara-platform-community-edition/), and unzip it in its place:

```shell
cd /usr/local
unzip payara-6.2025.2.zip
```

Replace the brand new `payara/glassfish/domains/domain1` with your old, preserved domain1:

```shell
mv payara6/glassfish/domains/domain1 payara6/glassfish/domains/domain1_DIST
mv payara6-2024.6/glassfish/domains/domain1 payara6/glassfish/domains/
```

Deploy/install as normal
