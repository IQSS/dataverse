### Experimental Support for External Vocabulary Services

This functionality was initially developed by [Data Archiving and Networked Services](http://dans.knaw.nl/en/) (DANS-KNAW), the Netherlands, and funded by [SSHOC](https://sshopencloud.eu), "Social Sciences and Humanities Open Cloud". SSHOC has received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 project call H2020-INFRAEOSC-04-2018, grant agreement #823782. It was further improved by the Global Dataverse Community Consortium (GDCC) and extended with the support of semantic search.

Please watch this [online presentation](https://youtu.be/mWMPxCwB2ys?t=1794), [read the document with requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1txdcFuxskRx_tLsDQ7KKLFTMR_r9IBhorDu3V_r445w/edit?ts=5fdbca9a) and join [Dataverse Working Group on Ontologies and Controlled Vocabularies](https://dataverse.org/community-calls) if you have some questions and want to contribute.

Dataverse can now be configured to associate specific metadata fields with third-party vocabulary services to provide an easy way for users to select values from those vocabularies. The mapping involves use of external Javascripts. Two such scripts have been developed so far: one for vocabularies served via the SKOSMOS protocol (see https://skosmos.org) and one allowing people to be identified via their ORCID (see https://orcid.org). The guides contain info about the new :CVocConf setting used for configuration and additional information about this functionality. Scripts, examples, and additional documentation are available at https://github.com/gdcc/dataverse-external-vocab-support.
