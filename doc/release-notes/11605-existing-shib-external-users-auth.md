Implemented a new feature flag ``dataverse.feature.api-bearer-auth-use-shib-user-on-id-match``, which supports the use of the new Dataverse client in instances that have historically allowed login via Shibboleth. Specifically, with this flag enabled, when an OIDC bridge is configured to allow OIDC login with validation by the bridged Shibboleth providers, users with existing Shibboleth-based accounts in Dataverse can log in to those accounts, thereby maintaining access to their existing content and retaining their roles. (For security reasons, Dataverse's current support for direct login via Shibboleth cannot be used in browser-based clients.)
