## Notes for Tool Developers and Integrators

Experimental endpoints have been added to allow auxiliary files to be added to datafiles. These auxiliary files can be deposited and accessed via API. Later releases will include options for accessing these files through the UI. For more information, see the Auxiliary File Support section of the [Developer Guide](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/5.3/developers/).
