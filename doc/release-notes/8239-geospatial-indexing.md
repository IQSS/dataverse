Support for indexing the "Geographic Bounding Box" fields ("West Longitude", "East Longitude", "North Latitude", and "South Latitude") from the Geospatial metadata block has been added.

Geospatial search is supported but only via API using two new parameters: `geo_point` and `geo_radius`.

A Solr schema update is required.
