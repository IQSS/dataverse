## Google Cloud Archiver

Dataverse Bags can now be sent to a bucket in Google Cloud, including those in the 'Coldline' storage class, which provide less expensive but slower access.

## Use Cases

- As an Administrator I can set up a regular export to Google Cloud so that my users' data is preserved.

## New Settings

:GoogleCloudProject - the name of the project managing the bucket.
:GoogleCloudBucket - the name of the bucket to use
