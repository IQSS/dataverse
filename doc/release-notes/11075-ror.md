### ROR (Research Organization Registry) as Author Identifier Type 

ROR (Research Organization Registry) has been added as an Author Identifier Type (alongside ORCID, etc.) for when the author is an organization rather than a person. As with all author identifiers, be sure to select the proper identifier type (e.g. "ROR") and enter just the unique identifier (e.g. "03vek6s52") rather than the full URL (e.g. "https://ror.org/03vek6s52"). Like ORCID, ROR will appear in the "Datacite" metadata export format. See also the [ROR](https://ror.org) website, a new [note](https://dataverse-guide--11118.org.readthedocs.build/en/11118/user/dataset-management.html#adding-a-new-dataset) in a guides about entering author identifiers, #11075, and #11118.

## Upgrade Instructions

6\. Update metadata blocks

These changes reflect incremental improvements made to the handling of core metadata fields. Expect the loading of the citation block to take several seconds because of its size (especially due to the number of languages).

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IQSS/dataverse/v6.6/scripts/api/data/metadatablocks/citation.tsv

curl http://localhost:8080/api/admin/datasetfield/load -H "Content-type: text/tab-separated-values" -X POST --upload-file citation.tsv
```
