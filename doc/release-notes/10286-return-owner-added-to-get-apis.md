The API endpoints for getting datasets, Dataverse collections, and datafiles have been extended to support the following optional 'returnOwners' query parameter.

Including the parameter and setting it to true will add a hierarchy showing which dataset and dataverse collection(s) the object is part of to the json object returned.
