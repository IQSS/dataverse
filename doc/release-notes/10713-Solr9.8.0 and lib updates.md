For the upgrade instructions section:

[note that 6.5 may contain other solr-related changes, so the instructions may need to contain information merged from multiple release notes!]

If you are upgrading Solr:
 - Install solr-9.8.0 following the instructions from the Installation guide.
 - Run a full reindex to populate the search catalog.
