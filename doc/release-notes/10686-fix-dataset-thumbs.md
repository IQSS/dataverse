A bug introduced in v6.3 (in #5621) can cause Dataset thumbnails to appear as broken links. This results from an underlying issue that causes the thumbnail generation to be marked as having failed in the database. THe bug fix will prevent this from happening in the future, but does not fix any existing broken links. To restore any broken thumbnails caused by this bug, you can call the http://localhost:8080/api/admin/clearThumbnailFailureFlag API, which will clear the flag on all files (regardless of whether caused by this bug or some other problem with the file) or the http://localhost:8080/api/admin/clearThumbnailFailureFlag/id to clear the flag for individual files. Calling the batch API is recommended.
