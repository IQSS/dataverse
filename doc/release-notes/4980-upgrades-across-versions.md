We now offer an *EXPERIMENTAL* database upgrade method allowing users
to skip over a number of releases. E.g., it should be possible now to
upgrade a Dataverse database from v4.8.6 directly to v4.10, without
having to deploy the war files for the 5 releases between these 2
versions and manually running the corresponding database upgrade
scripts.

The upgrade script, dbupgrade.sh is provided in the scripts/database
directory of the Dataverse source tree. See the file
README_upgrade_across_versions.txt for the instructions.
