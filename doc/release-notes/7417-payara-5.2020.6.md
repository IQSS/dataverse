## Update to Payara Platform 5.2020.6

In contrast to good old Glassfish 4, the Payara application server
is a maintained product, receiving both feature and - more important -
security and dependent technology updates. You should update the
application server platform on a regular basis, as it is a key component
of a running Dataverse deployment.

Instructions how to update can be found in the
[Payara documentation](https://docs.payara.fish/community/docs/5.2020.6/documentation/user-guides/upgrade-payara.html)
