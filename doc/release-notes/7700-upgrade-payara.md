### Payara 5.2021.4 (or Higher) Required

Some changes in this release require an upgrade to Payara 5.2021.4 or higher.

Instructions on how to update can be found in the
[Payara documentation](https://docs.payara.fish/community/docs/5.2021.4/documentation/user-guides/upgrade-payara.html)

It would likely be safer to upgrade Payara first, while still running Dataverse 5.6, and then proceed with the steps
below. Upgrading from an earlier version of Payara should be a straightforward process: 

1. Undeploy Dataverse
2. Stop Payara
3. Move the current Payara directory out of the way
4. Unzip the new Payara version in its place
5. Replace the brand new payara/glassfish/domains/domain1 with your old, preserved `domain1`
6. Start Payara, deploy Dataverse 5.6.
   
We still recommend that you read the detailed upgrade instructions above and if you run into any issues with this
upgrade, it will help to be able to separate them from any problems with the upgrade of Dataverse proper.
