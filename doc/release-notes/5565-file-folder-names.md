In this release users are given an option to edit the folder names in the file metadata. Strict validation rules for the folder names are also introduced. Only the following characters are allowed: the alphanumerics, '_', '-', '.' and ' ' (white space). Some datafiles in your Dataverse may already have folder names saved in the database (if they were extracted from uploaded zip archives with folder structure). The following sanitizing rules will be applied to all the existing folder names in the database: any invalid characters will be replaced by the '.' character. Any sequences of dots will be further replaced with a single dot. For example, the folder name ``data&info/code=@137`` will be converted to ``data.info/code.137``. This update will be automatically applied to the database the first time this release is deployed.
