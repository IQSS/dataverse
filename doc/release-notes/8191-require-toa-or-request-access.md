## Release Highlights

### Terms of Access or Request Access Required for Restricted Files

Beginning in this release, Restricted Files must have either Terms of Access or Request Access enabled. This change is to ensure that for each file in a Dataverse installation there is a clear path to get to the data, either through requesting access to the data or to provide context about why requesting access is not enabled.

## Notes for Dataverse Installation Administrators

### Identifying Datasets Requiring Terms of Access or Request Access Changes

In support of the change to require either Terms of Access or Request Access for all Restricted Files, we have provided a query to identify datasets in your installation where at least one file has neither Terms of Access or Request Access enabled:

This will allow you to reach out to those dataset owners as appropriate.
