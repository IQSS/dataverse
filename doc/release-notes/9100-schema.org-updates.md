Changes made in v5.13 and v5.14 in multiple PRs to improve the embedded Schema.org metadata in dataset pages will only be propagated to the Schema.Org JSON-LD metadata export if a reExportAll() is done.

The 5.14 release notes should include the standard instructions for doing a reExportAll after updating the code.
