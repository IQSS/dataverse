## Release Highlights

### Worldmap/Geoconnect Integration Now Obsolete

As of this release, the Geoconnect/Worldmap integration is no longer available. The Harvard University Worldmap is going through a migration process, and instead of updating this code to work with the new infrastructure, the decision was made to pursue future Geospatial exploration/analysis through other tools, following the External Tools Framework in the Dataverse Software.

## Notes to Admins

Take a backup of the Worldmap links, if any.
