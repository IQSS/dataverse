Auxiliary Files can now be downloaded from the web interface.

- Aux files uploaded as type=DP appear under "Differentially Private Statistics" under file level download. The rest appear under "Other Auxiliary Files".

In addition, related changes were made, including the following:

- New tooltip over the lock indicating if you have been granted access to a restricted file or not.
- When downloading individual files, you will see "Restricted with Access Granted" or just "Restricted" (followed by "Users may not request access to files.") as appropriate.
- When downloading individual files, instead of "Download" you should expect to see the file type such as "JPEG Image" or "Original File Format" if the type is unknown.
- Downloaded aux files now have a file extension if it can be determined.
