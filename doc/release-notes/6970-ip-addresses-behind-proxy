### Tracking users' IP addresses behind an address-masking proxy

It is now possible to collect real user IP addresses in MDC logs 
and/or set up an IP group on a system running behind a proxy/load balancer 
that hides the addresses of incoming requests. See "Recording User IP 
Addresses" in the Configuration section of the Installation Guide.
