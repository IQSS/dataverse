### Fix order of metadata fields on the advanced search page

The metadata fields are now displayed in the correct order as defined in the TSV file via the displayOrder value.
The order of the fields on the AdvancedSearch page will then be more similar to that on the metadata forms. 
Note that fields that are not defined in the TSV file, like the 'Persistent ID' and 'Publication Date', will be displayed at the end.
