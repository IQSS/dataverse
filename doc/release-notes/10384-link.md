### Broken Link in Email When Users Request Access to Files

When users request access to a files, the people who have permission to grant access receive an email with a link in it that didn't work due to a trailing period (full stop) right next to the link (e.g. `https://demo.dataverse.org/permissions-manage-files.xhtml?id=9.`) A space has been added to fix this. See #10384 and #11115.
