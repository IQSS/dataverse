Release Highlights:
An experimental "Archival" metadata block has been added, [downloadable](https://dataverse-guide--10626.org.readthedocs.build/en/10626/user/appendix.html) from the User Guide. The purpose of the metadata block is to enable repositories to register metadata relating to the potential archiving of the dataset at a depositor archive, whether that being your own institutional archive or an external archive, i.e. a historical archive. See also #10626.
