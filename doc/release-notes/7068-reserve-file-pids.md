## Release Highlights

### Pre-Publish File DOI Reservation with DataCite

Dataverse installations using DataCite will be able to reserve the persistent identifiers for files with DataCite ahead of publishing time. This allows the file DOI to be reserved earlier in the data sharing process and makes the step of publishing datasets simpler and less error-prone.

## Major Use Cases

- Users will have DOIs reserved for their files upon dataset create instead of at publish time. (Issue #7068, PR #7334)
