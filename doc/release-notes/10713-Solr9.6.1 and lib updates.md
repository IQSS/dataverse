Solr 9.6.1 is now the version recommended in our installation guides and used with automated testing. Other libraries Dataverse uses have been updated as well.

For the upgrade instructions section:

[note that 6.5 may contain other solr-related changes, so the instructions may need to contain information merged from multiple release notes!]

If you are upgrading Solr:
 - Install solr-9.6.1 following the instructions from the Installation guide.
 - Run a full reindex to populate the search catalog.
 - Note that it may be possible to skip the reindexing step by simply moving the existing `.../server/solr/collection1/` under the new `solr-9.6.1` installation directory. This however has not been thoroughly tested and is not officially supported.
