# Dataverse 6.6

Please note: To read these instructions in full, please go to https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/releases/tag/v6.6 rather than the [list of releases](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/releases), which will cut them off.

This release brings new features, enhancements, and bug fixes to Dataverse. Thank you to all of the community members who contributed code, suggestions, bug reports, and other assistance across the project!

## Release Highlights

Highlights for Dataverse 6.6 include:

- license metadata enhancements
- metadata fields now support range searches (dates, integers, etc.)
- more accurate search highlighting
- collections can be moved from the superuser dashboard
- new 3D Objects metadata block
- optionally prevent publishing of datasets without files
- infrastructure updates (Payara and Solr)

## Features Added

### License Metadata Enhancements

- Added new fields to licenses: rightsIdentifier, rightsIdentifierScheme, schemeUri, languageCode (see JSON files under [Adding Licenses](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/6.6/installation/config.html#adding-licenses) in the guides)
- Updated DataCite metadata export to include rightsIdentifier, rightsIdentifierScheme, and schemeUri consistent with the DataCite 4.5 schema and examples
- Enhanced metadata exports to include all new license fields
- Existing licenses from the example set included with Dataverse will be automatically updated with new fields
- Existing API calls support the new optional fields

See below for upgrade instructions. See also #10883 and #11232.

### Range Search

This release enhances how numerical and date fields are indexed in Solr. Previously, all fields were indexed as English text (`text_en`), but with this update:

* Integer fields are indexed as `plong`
* Float fields are indexed as `pdouble`
* Date fields are indexed as `date_range` (`solr.DateRangeField`)

This change enables range queries when searching from both the UI and the API, such as `dateOfDeposit:[2000-01-01 TO 2014-12-31]` or `targetSampleActualSize:[25 TO 50]`. See below for a full list of fields that now support range search.

Additionally, search result highlighting is now more accurate, ensuring that only fields relevant to the query are highlighted in search results. If the query is specifically limited to certain fields, the highlighting is now limited to those fields as well. See #10887.

Specifically, the following fields were updated:

- coverage.Depth
- coverage.ObjectCount
- coverage.ObjectDensity
- coverage.Redshift.MaximumValue
- coverage.Redshift.MinimumValue
- coverage.RedshiftValue
- coverage.SkyFraction
- coverage.Spectral.CentralWavelength
- coverage.Spectral.MaximumWavelength
- coverage.Spectral.MinimumWavelength
- coverage.Temporal.StartTime
- coverage.Temporal.StopTime
- dateOfCollectionEnd
- dateOfCollectionStart
- dateOfDeposit
- distributionDate
- dsDescriptionDate
- journalPubDate
- productionDate
- resolution.Redshift
- targetSampleActualSize
- timePeriodCoveredEnd
- timePeriodCoveredStart

### New 3D Objects Metadata Block

A new metadata block has been added for describing 3D object data. You can download it from the [guides](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/6.6/user/appendix.html). See also #11120 and #11167.

All new Dataverse installations will receive this metadata block by default. We recommend adding it by following the upgrade instructions below.

## Prevent Publishing of Datasets Without Files

Datasets without files can be optionally prevented from being published through a new "requireFilesToPublishDataset" boolean defined at the collection level. This boolean can only be set via API and only by a superuser (see [Change Collection Attributes](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/6.6/api/native-api.html#change-collection-attributes)). If the boolean is not set, the parent collection is consulted. If you do not set the boolean, the existing behavior of datasets being able to be published without files will continue. Superusers can still publish datasets whether or not the boolean is set. See #10981 and #10994.

### Other Features

- In addition to the API [Move a Dataverse Collection](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/6.6/admin/dataverses-datasets.html#move-a-dataverse-collection), it is now possible for a Dataverse administrator to move a collection from the Dataverse dashboard. See #10304 and #11150.
- The Preview URL popup and [related documentation](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/6.6/user/dataset-management.html#preview-url-to-review-unpublished-dataset) have been updated to give more information about anonymous access including the names of the dataset fields that will be withheld from the Anonymous Preview URL user and to suggest how to review the URL before releasing it. See also #11159 and #11164.
- [ROR](https://ror.org) (Research Organization Registry) has been added as an Author Identifier Type (alongside ORCID, etc.) for when the author is an organization rather than a person. Like ORCID, ROR will appear in the "Datacite" metadata export format. See #11075 and #11118.
- The [Metadata Customization](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/6.6/admin/metadatacustomization.html#controlledvocabulary-enumerated-properties) documentation has been updated to explain how to implement a boolean fieldtype (look for "boolean"). See #7961 and #11064.
- It is now possible to populate the "Keyword" metadata field from an [OntoPortal](https://ontoportal.org) service. The code has been shared to the GDCC [dataverse-external-vocab-support](https://github.com/gdcc/dataverse-external-vocab-support#scripts-in-production) GitHub repository. See #11258.
- Payara application server has been upgraded to version 6.2025.2. See #11126 and #11128.
- Solr has been upgraded to version 9.8.0. See #10713.

## Bugs Fixed

- A bug which causes users of the Anonymous Review URL to have some metadata of published datasets withheld has been fixed. See #11202 and #11164.
- The file page version table now shows whether a file has been replaced. See #11142 and #11145.
- The OpenAIRE metadata export format can now correctly process one or multiple productionPlaces as geolocation. See #9546 and #11194
- A bug that caused adding free-form provenance to a file to fail has been fixed. See #11145.
- A bug has been fixed which could cause publication of datasets to fail in cases where they were not assigned a DOI at creation. See #11234 and #11236.
- Dataverse 6.5 introduced a bug which causes search to fail for non-superusers in multiple groups when the `AVOID_EXPENSIVE_SOLR_JOIN` feature flag is set to true. This release fixes the bug. See #11133 and #11134.
- Fix a bug with My Data where listing collections for a user with only rights on harvested collections would result in a server error response. See #11083.
- Minor styling fixes for the Related Publication field and fields using ORCID or ROR have been made. See #11053, #10964, and #11106.
- In the Search API, files were displaying DRAFT version instead of latest released version under `dataset_citation`. See #10735 and #11051.

## API Updates

### Search API Returns Additional Fields for Files

Added new fields to search results type=files

For Files:

- restricted: boolean
- canDownloadFile: boolean ( from file user permission)
- categories: array of string "categories" would be similar to what it is in metadata api.

For tabular files:

- tabularTags: array of string for example, `{"tabularTags" : ["Event", "Genomics", "Geospatial"]}`
- variables: number/int shows how many variables we have for the tabular file
- observations: number/int shows how many observations for the tabular file

See #11027 and #11097.

### Other API Updates

- Multiple files can be deleted from a dataset at once. See the [the guides](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/6.6/api/native-api.html#delete-files-from-a-dataset) and #11230.

## Upgrade Instructions

Upgrading requires a maintenance window and downtime. Please plan accordingly, create backups of your database, etc.

These instructions assume that you've already upgraded through all the 5.x releases and are now running Dataverse 6.5.

0\. These instructions assume that you are upgrading from the immediate previous version. If you are running an earlier version, the only supported way to upgrade is to progress through the upgrades to all the releases in between before attempting the upgrade to this version.

If you are running Payara as a non-root user (and you should be!), **remember not to execute the commands below as root**. By default, Payara runs as the `dataverse` user. In the commands below, we use sudo to run the commands as a non-root user.

Also, we assume that Payara 6 is installed in `/usr/local/payara6`. If not, adjust as needed.

```shell
export PAYARA=/usr/local/payara6
```

(or `setenv PAYARA /usr/local/payara6` if you are using a `csh`-like shell)

1\. List deployed applications

```shell
$PAYARA/bin/asadmin list-applications
```

2\. Undeploy the previous version (should match "list-applications" above)

```shell
$PAYARA/bin/asadmin undeploy dataverse-6.4
```

3\. Stop Payara

```shell
sudo service payara stop
```

4\. Upgrade to Payara 6.2025.2

The steps below reuse your existing domain directory with the new distribution of Payara. You may also want to review the Payara upgrade instructions as it could be helpful during any troubleshooting:
[Payara Release Notes](https://docs.payara.fish/community/docs/6.2025.2/Release%20Notes/Release%20Notes%206.2025.2.html).
We also recommend you ensure you followed all update instructions from the past releases regarding Payara.
(The most recent Payara update was for [v6.3](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/releases/tag/v6.3).)

Move the current Payara directory out of the way:

```shell
mv $PAYARA $PAYARA.6.2024.6
```

Download the new Payara version 6.2025.2 (from https://www.payara.fish/downloads/payara-platform-community-edition/ or https://nexus.payara.fish/repository/payara-community/fish/payara/distributions/payara/6.2025.2/payara-6.2025.2.zip), and unzip it in its place:

```shell
cd /usr/local
unzip payara-6.2025.2.zip
```

Replace the brand new `payara/glassfish/domains/domain1` with your old, preserved domain1:

```shell
mv payara6/glassfish/domains/domain1 payara6/glassfish/domains/domain1_DIST
mv payara6.6.2024.6/glassfish/domains/domain1 payara6/glassfish/domains/
```

5\. Download and deploy this version

```shell
wget https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/releases/download/v6.5/dataverse-6.6.war
$PAYARA/bin/asadmin deploy dataverse-6.6.war
```

Note: if you have any trouble deploying, stop Payara, remove the following directories, start Payara, and try to deploy again.

```shell
sudo service payara stop
sudo rm -rf $PAYARA/glassfish/domains/domain1/generated
sudo rm -rf $PAYARA/glassfish/domains/domain1/osgi-cache
sudo rm -rf $PAYARA/glassfish/domains/domain1/lib/databases
sudo service payara start
```

6\. For installations with internationalization:

Please remember to update translations via [Dataverse language packs](https://github.com/GlobalDataverseCommunityConsortium/dataverse-language-packs).

7\. Restart Payara

```shell
sudo service payara stop
sudo service payara start
```

8\. Update metadata blocks

These changes reflect incremental improvements made to the handling of core metadata fields.

Expect the loading of the citation block to take several seconds because of its size (especially due to the number of languages).

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IQSS/dataverse/v6.6/scripts/api/data/metadatablocks/citation.tsv

curl http://localhost:8080/api/admin/datasetfield/load -H "Content-type: text/tab-separated-values" -X POST --upload-file citation.tsv
```

The 3D Objects metadata block is included in all new installations of Dataverse so we recommend adding it.

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IQSS/dataverse/v6.6/scripts/api/data/metadatablocks/3d_objects.tsv

curl http://localhost:8080/api/admin/datasetfield/load -H "Content-type: text/tab-separated-values" -X POST --upload-file 3d_objects.tsv
```

9\. Upgrade Solr

Solr 9.8.0 is now the version recommended in our Installation Guide and used with automated testing. Additionally, due to the new range search support feature and the addition of fields (e.g. fileRestricted, canDownloadFile, variableCount, and observations), the default `schema.xml` files has changed so you must upgrade.

Install Solr 9.8.0 following the [instructions](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/6.6/installation/prerequisites.html#solr) from the Installation Guide.

The instructions in the guide suggest to use the config files from the installer zip bundle. When upgrading an existing instance, it may be easier to download them from the source tree:

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IQSS/dataverse/v6.6/conf/solr/solrconfig.xml
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IQSS/dataverse/v6.6/conf/solr/schema.xml
cp solrconfig.xml schema.xml /usr/local/solr/solr-9.8.0/server/solr/collection1/conf
```

9a\. For installations with custom or experimental metadata blocks, update fields

- Stop Solr instance (usually `service solr stop`, depending on Solr installation/OS, see the [Installation Guide](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/6.6/installation/prerequisites.html#solr-init-script)).

- Run the `update-fields.sh` script that we supply, as in the example below (modify the command lines as needed to reflect the correct path of your Solr installation):

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IQSS/dataverse/v6.6/conf/solr/update-fields.sh
chmod +x update-fields.sh
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/admin/index/solr/schema" | ./update-fields.sh /usr/local/solr/solr-9.8.0/server/solr/collection1/conf/schema.xml
```

- Start Solr instance (usually `service solr start` depending on Solr/OS).

10\. Reindex Solr

```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/api/admin/index
```

11\. Run reExportAll to update dataset metadata exports

For existing published datasets, additional license metadata will not be available from DataCite or in metadata exports until

- the dataset is republished or
- the /api/admin/metadata/{id}/reExportDataset is run for the dataset or
- the /api/datasets/{id}/modifyRegistrationMetadata API is run for the dataset or
- the global version of these API calls (/api/admin/metadata/reExportAll, /api/datasets/modifyRegistrationPIDMetadataAll) are used.

For this reason, we recommend reexporting all dataset metadata. For more advanced usage, please see [the guides](http://guides.dataverse.org/en/6.6/admin/metadataexport.html#batch-exports-through-the-api).

```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/api/admin/metadata/reExportAll
```
