Bug fixed for the ``incomplete metadata`` label being shown for published dataset with incomplete metadata in certain scenarios. This label will now be shown for draft versions of such datasets and published datasets that the user can edit. This label can also be made invisible for published datasets (regardless of edit rights) with the new option ``dataverse.ui.show-validity-label-when-published`` set to `false`.
