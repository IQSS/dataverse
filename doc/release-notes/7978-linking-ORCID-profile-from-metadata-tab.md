### Displaying author's identifier as link

In the dataset page's metadata tab the author's identifier is displayed as a clickable link, which points to the profile page in the external service (ORCID, VIAF etc.), given that the identifier scheme provides a resolvable landing page. If the identifier does not match the expected scheme, a link is not shown.
