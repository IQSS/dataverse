### Auxiliary File API Enhancements

This release includes updates to the Auxiliary File API:
- Auxiliary files can now also be associated with non-tabular files
- Improved error reporting
- The API will block attempts to create a duplicate auxiliary file
- Delete and list-by-original calls have been added

Please note that the auxiliary files feature is experimental and is designed to support integration with tools from the [OpenDP Project](https://opendp.org). If the API endpoints are not needed they can be blocked.
