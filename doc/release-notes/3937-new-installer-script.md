## New Installer Script 

We are introducing a new installer script, written in Python. It is
intended to eventually replace the old installer (written in
Perl). But for now it is being offered as an (experimental)
alternative.

See README_python.txt in scripts/installer and/or in the installer
bundle for more information.
