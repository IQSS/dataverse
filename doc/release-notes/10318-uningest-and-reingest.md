New Uningest/Reingest options are available in the File Page Edit menu, allowing ingest errors to be cleared (by users who can published the associated dataset)
and (by suerpsuers) for a successful ingest to be undone or retried (e.g. after a Dataverse version update or if ingest size limits are changed).
The /api/files/<id>/uningest api also now allows users who can publish the dataset to undo an ingest failure.
