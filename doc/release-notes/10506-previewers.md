### File Previews Available in Dev Environment, More Docs

In Dataverse 6.5 File Previewers were enabled in the "demo or eval" containerized (Dockerized) environment (#11025). These previewers are now available in the development environment as well and [documentation](https://dataverse-guide--11181.org.readthedocs.build/en/11181/container/running/demo.html#file-previewers) has been added explaining how to configure them. See also #10506 and #11181.
