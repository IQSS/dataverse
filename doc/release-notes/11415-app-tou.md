### Application Terms of Use Available via API

It's now possible to retrieve the Application Terms of Use (called General Terms of Use in the UI) via API. These are the terms users agree to when creating an account. See [the guides](https://dataverse-guide--11422.org.readthedocs.build/en/11422/api/native-api.html#get-application-terms-of-use-general-terms-of-use), #11415 and #11422.
