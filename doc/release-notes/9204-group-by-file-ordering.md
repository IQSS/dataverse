### Support for Grouping Dataset Files by Folder and Category Tag

Dataverse now supports grouping dataset files by folder and/or optionally by Tag/Category. The default for whether to order by folder can be changed via :OrderByFolder. Ordering by category must be enabled by an administrator via the :CategoryOrder parameter which is used to specify which tags appear first (e.g. to put Documentation files before Data or Code files, etc.) These Group-By options work with the existing sort options, i.e. sorting alphabetically means that files within each folder or tag group will be sorted alphabetically. :AllowUsersToManageOrdering can be set to true to allow users to turn folder ordering and category ordering (if enabled) on or off in the current dataset view.

### New Setting

:CategoryOrder - a comma separated list of Category/Tag names defining the order in which files with those tags should be displayed. The setting can include custom tag names along with the pre-defined defaults ( Documentation, Data, and Code, which can be overridden by the ::FileCategories setting.)
:OrderByFolder - defaults to true - whether to group files in the same folder together
:AllowUserManagementOfOrder - default false - allow users to toggle ordering on/off in the dataset display
