# Release Highlights

### Dataset Migration API (Experimental)

Datasets can now imported following the format of an OAI-ORE export (RDA-conformant Bags), allowing for easier migration from one Dataverse installation to another, and migration from other systems. This experimental, super-user only, endpoint also allows keeping the existing persistent identifier (where the authority and shoulder match those for which the software is configured) and publication dates.

This development was supported by DANS and the [Research Data Alliance](https://rd-alliance.org) and follows the recommendations from the [Research Data Repository Interoperability Working Group](http://dx.doi.org/10.15497/RDA00025).
