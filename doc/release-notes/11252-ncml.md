## NcML Previewer Bug Fix

[Dataverse Previewers](https://github.com/gdcc/dataverse-previewers) v1.4 contains a bug in the NcML previewer that prevents it from working with signed URLs. (See #11252 for screenshots.)

This has been [fixed](https://github.com/gdcc/dataverse-previewers/commit/2211989e7b9e12c875e18b4893ba4f1dfb1603a5) in the "betatest" version of the previewer.

Until v1.5 is released, we recommend [deleting](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/6.5/admin/external-tools.html#managing-external-tools) the v1.4 version and switching to the "betatest" version. This can be achieved by editing the [curl command](https://github.com/gdcc/dataverse-previewers/blob/develop/6.1curlcommands.md#ncml-previewer) for the NcML previewer, changing this line...

`"toolUrl":"https://gdcc.github.io/dataverse-previewers/previewers/v1.4/NcmlPreview.html",`

... to...

`"toolUrl":"https://gdcc.github.io/dataverse-previewers/previewers/betatest/NcmlPreview.html",`

Note that there are two curl commands as the NcML tool supports two content types:

- `"contentType":"application/x-hdf5"`
- `"contentType":"application/netcdf"`
