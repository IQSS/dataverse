## RO-Crate Support (Metadata Export)

Dataverse now supports [RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/) in the sense that dataset metadata can be exported in that format. This functionality is not available out of the box but you can enable one or more RO-Crate exporters from the [list of external exporters](https://preview.guides.gdcc.io/en/develop/installation/advanced.html#inventory-of-external-exporters). See also #10744.
