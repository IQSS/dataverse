Dataverse now includes improved integration with ORCID, supported through a grant to GDCC from the ([ORCID Global Participation Fund](https://info.orcid.org/global-participation-fund-announces-fourth-round-of-awardees/).)[https://info.orcid.org/global-participation-fund-announces-fourth-round-of-awardees/]. 

Specifically, Dataverse users can now link their Dataverse account with their ORCID profile which then allows Dataverse to use automatically add their ORCID to their author metadata when they create a dataset.

This functionality leverages Dataverse's existing support for login via ORCID, but can be turned on independently of it. If ORCID login is enabled, the user's ORCID will automatically be added to their profile. If the user has logged in via some other mechanism, they are able to click a button to initiate a similar authentication process in which the user must login to their ORCID account and approve the connection. 

Feedback from installations that enable this functionality is requested and we expect that updates can be made in the next Dataverse release.
