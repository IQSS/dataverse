Solr has been upgraded to Solr 9. You must install Solr fresh and reindex. You cannot use your old schema.xml because the format has changed.

Specifically, to install Solr fresh you should follow the instructions for new installations, found at https://guides.dataverse.org/en/9260-solr930/installation/prerequisites.html#installing-solr

These instructions are copied below and tweaked a bit for an upgrade scenario.

We assume that you already have a user called "solr" (from the instructions above), added during your initial installation of Solr.

1. Become the "solr" user and then download and configure Solr.

   ```
   su - solr
   cd /usr/local/solr
   wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/lucene/solr/9.3.0/solr-9.3.0.tgz
   tar xvzf solr-9.3.0.tgz
   cd solr-9.3.0
   cp -r server/solr/configsets/_default server/solr/collection1
   ```

1. Unzip "dvinstall.zip" from this release. Unzip it into /tmp. Then copy the following files into place.

   ```
   cp /tmp/dvinstall/schema*.xml /usr/local/solr/solr-9.3.0/server/solr/collection1/conf

   cp /tmp/dvinstall/solrconfig.xml /usr/local/solr/solr-9.3.0/server/solr/collection1/conf
   ```

1. Tell Solr to create the core "collection1" on startup.

   ```
   echo "name=collection1" > /usr/local/solr/solr-9.3.0/server/solr/collection1/core.properties
   ```

1. Update your init script.

   Your init script may be located at `/etc/systemd/system/solr.service`, for example. Update the path to Solr to be `/usr/local/solr/solr-9.3.0`.

1. Start Solr using your init script and check collection1.

   The collection1 check below should print out fields Dataverse uses like "dsDescription".

   ```
   systemctl start solr.service
   curl http://localhost:8983/solr/collection1/schema/fields
   ```

1. Reindex Solr.

   For details, see https://guides.dataverse.org/en/9260-solr930/admin/solr-search-index.html

   ```
   curl http://localhost:8080/api/admin/index
   ```

1. If you have custom metadata blocks installed, you must update your Solr schema.xml to include your custom fields.

   For details, please see https://guides.dataverse.org/en/9260-solr930/admin/metadatacustomization.html#updating-the-solr-schema

   At a high level you will be copying custom fields from the output of http://localhost:8080/api/admin/index/solr/schema or using a script to automate this.
