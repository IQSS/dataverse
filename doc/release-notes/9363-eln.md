Support for .eln files has been added.

See file format specification: https://github.com/TheELNConsortium/TheELNFileFormat

The .eln file format is used by Electronic Laboratory Notebooks as an exchange format for experimental protocols, results, sample descriptions, etc...

In order for existing .eln files to show as zip files (instead of unknown), you must run the file re-detection API on them and reindex them into Solr.
