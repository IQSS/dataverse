### Dataverse Linking Fix

The fix implemented for ticket 6262 will display the datasets contained in linked dataverses in the linking dataverse. Going forward this will happen automatically whenever a dataverse is linked. 
In order for datasets belonging to dataverses previously linked to be displayed properly in the linking dataverse you must re-index those dataverses that had been linked. It's probably easiest to simply re-index all.
