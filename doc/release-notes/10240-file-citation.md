## Get file citation as JSON

It is now possible to retrieve via API the file citation as it appears on the file landing page. It is formatted in HTML and encoded in JSON.

This API is not for downloading various citation formats such as EndNote XML, RIS, or BibTeX. This functionality has been requested in https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/3140 and https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/9994
