This release has a new feature that allows users to control which notifications they receive. How to enable this feature and which options can be set by the admins is described in the [Letting users manage receiving notifications section of the Admin Guide](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/admin/user-administration.html#letting-users-manage-receiving-notifications). See also #7492.

In addition, the existing API endpoint for listing notifications has been enhanced to show the subject, text, and timestamp of notifications. See also #8487.
