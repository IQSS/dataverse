## Update to Payara 5.2020.5

In contrast to good old Glassfish 4, the Payara application server
is a maintained product, receiving both feature and - more important -
security and dependent technology updates.

You should update the application server platform on a regular basis, as it 
is a key component of a running Dataverse deployment. With this version of 
Dataverse, we rely on Payara 5.2020.5.

Instructions how to update can be found in the
[Payara documentation](https://docs.payara.fish/community/docs/5.2020.5/documentation/user-guides/upgrade-payara.html)
