## Adding Computational Workflow Metadata
The new Computational Workflow metadata block will allow depositors to effectively tag datasets as computational workflows.

To add the new metadata block, follow the instructions in the user guide: <https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/admin/metadatacustomization.html>

The location of the new metadata block tsv file is: `dataverse/scripts/api/data/metadatablocks/computational_workflow.tsv`
