Dataverse can now be configured (via the dataverse.files.guestbook-at-request option) to display any configured guestbook to users when they request restricted file(s) or when they download files (the historic default).
The global default defined by this setting can be overridden at the collection level on the collection page and at the individual dataset level by a superuser using the API. The default - showing guestbooks when files are downloaded - remains as it was in prior Dataverse versions.
