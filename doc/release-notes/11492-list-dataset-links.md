The [API for listing the collections a dataset has been linked to](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/admin/dataverses-datasets.html#list-collections-that-are-linked-from-a-dataset) (`api/datasets/$linked-dataset-id/links`) is no longer restricted to superusers. For unpublished datasets, users need the "View Unpublished Dataset" permission to access the API. Unpublished collections in the list require the "View Unpublished Dataverse" permission; otherwise, they are hidden.
