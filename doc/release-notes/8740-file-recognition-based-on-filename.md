### File types detection

File types are now detected based on the filename when the file has no extension.

The following filenames are now detected:

- Makefile=text/x-makefile
- Snakemake=text/x-snakemake
- Dockerfile=application/x-docker-file
- Vagrantfile=application/x-vagrant-file

These are defined in `MimeTypeDetectionByFileName.properties`.
