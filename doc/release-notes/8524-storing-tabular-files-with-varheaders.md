Tabular Data Ingest can now save the generated archival files with the list of variable names added as the first tab-delimited line. As the most significant effect of this feature,
Access API will be able to take advantage of Direct Download for tab. files saved with these headers on S3 - since they no longer have to be generated and added to the streamed content on the fly.

This behavior is controlled by the new setting `:StoreIngestedTabularFilesWithVarHeaders`. It is false by default, preserving the legacy behavior. When enabled, Dataverse will be able to handle both the newly ingested files, and any already-existing legacy files stored without these headers transparently to the user. E.g. the access API will continue delivering tab-delimited files **with** this header line, whether it needs to add it dynamically for the legacy files, or reading complete files directly from storage for the ones stored with it.

An API for converting existing legacy tabular files will be added separately. [this line will need to be changed if we have time to add said API before 6.2 is released].
