It is now possible to link draft datasets to other Dataverse collections. As usual, the datasets will only become publicly visible in the linked collection(s) after they have been published. To publish a linked dataset, your account must have the "Publish Dataset" permission for the Dataverse collection in which the dataset was originally created. Permissions in the linked Dataverse collections do not apply.
