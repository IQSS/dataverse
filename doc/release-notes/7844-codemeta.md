# Experimental CodeMeta Schema Support

With this release, we are adding "experimental" (see note below) support for research software metadata deposits.

By adding a metadata block for [CodeMeta](https://codemeta.github.io), we take another step extending the Dataverse
scope being a research data repository towards first class support of diverse F.A.I.R. objects, currently focusing
on research software and computational workflows.

There is more work underway to make Dataverse installations around the world "research software ready". We hope
for feedback from installations on the new metadata block to optimize and lift it from the experimental stage.

**Note:** like the metadata block for computational workflows before, this schema is flagged as "experimental".
"Experimental" means it's brand new, opt-in, and might need future tweaking based on experience of usage in the field.
These blocks are listed here: https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/user/appendix.html#experimental-metadata
