The publisher value of harvested datasets is now attributed to the dataset's distributor instead of its producer. This improves the citation associated with these datasets, but the change only affects newly harvested datasets. All datasets should be re-harvested if you wish to pick up this change on already harvested datasets. For more information, see [the guides](https://dataverse-guide--9013.org.readthedocs.build/en/9013/admin/harvestclients.html#harvesting-client-changelog), #8739, and #9013.
