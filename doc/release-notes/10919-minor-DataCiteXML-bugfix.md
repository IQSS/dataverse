A minor bug fix was made to avoid sending a useless ", null" in the DataCiteXML sent to DataCite and in the DataCite export when a dataset has a metadata entry for "Software Name" and no entry for "Software Version". The bug fix will update datasets upon publication. Anyone with existing published datasets with this problem can be fixed by [pushing updated metadata to DataCite for affected datasets](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/6.4/admin/dataverses-datasets.html#update-metadata-for-a-published-dataset-at-the-pid-provider) and [re-exporting the dataset metadata](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/6.4/admin/metadataexport.html#batch-exports-through-the-api) or by following steps 9 and 10 in the v6.4 release notes to update and re-export all datasets.
