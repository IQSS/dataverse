### Adding versioned tags to Container Base Images

With this release we introduce a detailed maintenance workflow for our container images.
As output of the GDCC Containerization Working Group, the community takes another step towards production ready containers available directly from the core project.

The maintenance workflow regularly updates the Container Base Image, which contains the operating system, Java, Payara Application Server, as well as tools and libraries required by the Dataverse application.
Shipping these rolling releases as well as immutable revisions is the foundation for secure and reliable Dataverse Application Container images.
