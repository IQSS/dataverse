The Schema.org metadata export and the schema.org metadata embedded in dataset pages has been updated to improve compliance with Schema.org's schema and Google's recommendations.

Backward compatibility - file entries now have the mimetype reported as 'encodingFormat' rather than 'fileFormat' to better conform with the Schema.org specification for DataDownload entries.
