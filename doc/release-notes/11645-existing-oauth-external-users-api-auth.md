Implemented a new feature flag ``dataverse.feature.api-bearer-auth-use-oauth-user-on-id-match``, which supports the use of the new Dataverse client in instances that have historically allowed login via GitHub, ORCID, or Google. Specifically, with this flag enabled, when an OIDC bridge is configured to allow OIDC login with validation by the bridged OAuth providers, users with existing GitHub, ORCID, or Google accounts in Dataverse can log in to those accounts, thereby maintaining access to their existing content and retaining their roles.
