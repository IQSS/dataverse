# Broader MicroProfile Config Support for Developers

As of this release, many [JVM options](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/installation/config.html#jvm-options)
can be set using any [MicroProfile Config Source](https://docs.payara.fish/community/docs/Technical%20Documentation/MicroProfile/Config/Overview.html#config-sources).

Currently this change is only relevant to developers but as settings are migrated to the new "lookup" pattern documented in the [Consuming Configuration](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/developers/configuration.html) section of the Developer Guide, anyone installing the Dataverse software will have much greater flexibility when configuring those settings, especially within containers. These changes will be announced in future releases.

Please note that an upgrade to Payara 5.2021.8 or higher is required to make use of this. Payara 5.2021.5 threw exceptions, as explained in PR #8823.
