# DEFAULTS FOR TESTS
# Unlike src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties, this file will not be included in
# a packaged WAR. It can be used to provide sane defaults for things like unit tests on classes requiring
# some sort of configuration.

# PersistentIdentifierServiceBeanTest loads all the providers, which makes the EZID provider reach out
# to the service - switching to example.org to not trigger a DDoS via test executions at their place.
dataverse.pid.ezid.api-url=http://example.org
# Also requires the username and the password to be present when used in production, use a default for unit testing.
dataverse.pid.ezid.username=Dataverse Unit Test
dataverse.pid.ezid.password=supersecret
