/**
 * We define Solr search fields here in one central place so they can be used
 * throughout the code but renamed here if need be.
 *
 * Note that there are many fields in Solr that are *not* here because their
 * values come from the database. For example "authorName" comes from the
 * database. We update the Solr schema.xml file by merging the output of `curl
 * http://localhost:8080/api/admin/index/solr/schema` into the file in the
 * source tree when a metadata block update warrants it.
 *
 * Generally speaking, we want the search fields to be readable. This is a
 * challenge for long field names but a power user should be able to type
 * "authorAffiliation:Harvard" into the general search box. A regular user is
 * much more likely to used Advanced Search to populate that field
 * automatically.
 *
 * Originally, these fields were all snake_case but since the dynamic fields are
 * camelCase we might want to standardize on that.
 *
 * You'll notice that dynamic fields like this are used...
 *
 * - _s (string)
 *
 * - _ss (multivalued string)
 *
 * - _l (long)
 *
 * - _dt (datetime)
 *
 * ... and these endings should not be changed unless you plan to convert them
 * to non-dynamic (by removing the ending) and specify their "type" in the Solr
 * schema.xml.
 *
 * Most fields we want to be searchable but some are stored with indexed=false
 * because we *don't* want them to be searchable and we're just using Solr as a
 * convenient key/value store. Why go to the database if you don't have to? For
 * a string here or there that needs to be available to both the GUI and the
 * Search API, we can just store them in Solr.
 *
 * For faceting we use a "string" type. If you use something like "text_general"
 * the field is tokenized ("Foo Bar" becomes "foo" "bar" which is not what we
 * want). See also
 * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16559911/facet-query-will-give-wrong-output-on-dynamicfield-in-solr
