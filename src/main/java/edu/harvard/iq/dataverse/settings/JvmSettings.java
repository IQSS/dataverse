 * Enum to store each and every JVM-based setting as a reference,

 *
 * To be able to have more control over JVM settings names,
 * avoid typos, maybe create lists of settings and so on,
 * this enum will provide the place to add any old and new
 * settings that are destined to be made at the JVM level.
 *
 * Further extensions of this class include
 * - adding aliases when renaming settings,
 * - adding predicates for validation and
 * - offering injecting parameters into keys (as used with the file access subsystem).
