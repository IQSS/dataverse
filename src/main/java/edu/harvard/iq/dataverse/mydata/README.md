## How does the myData section work?

Before working on this section, please read this document located in the Dataverse repository:

  - /dataverse/doc/Architecture/myData/MyData-Cards.pdf

Alternately, if you have access, the original presentation is in Google slides:

  - https://docs.google.com/a/harvard.edu/presentation/d/1aHjOMy8FIbMVyJEZu_m4ab4ftutgQiC8y6HM47Am2z0/edit?usp=sharing

The PDF above gives an overview of what the MyData code is trying to accomplish and the relationship between the different classes/objects.

  - The **last diagram in the PDF may be especially helpful**.
