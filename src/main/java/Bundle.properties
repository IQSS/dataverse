harvestclients.noClients.why.reason1=Harvesting is a process of exchanging metadata with other repositories.

These can be other Dataverse instances, or other archives that support OAI-PMH, the standard harvesting protocol. 
harvestclients.noClients.why.reason2=Harvested metadata records are searchable by users. Clicking on a harvested dataset in the search results takes the user to the original repository. Harvested datasets cannot be edited in your Dataverse installation. 
harvestclients.noClients.how.header=How To Use Harvesting
harvestclients.noClients.how.tip1=To harvest metadata, a <i>Harvesting Client</i> is created and configured for each remote repository. Note that when creating a client you will need to select an existing local dataverse to host harvested datasets.

harvestclients.noClients.how.tip2=Harvested records can be kept in sync with the original repository through scheduled incremental updates, for example, daily or weekly. Alternatively, harvests can be run on demand, from this page or via the REST API.

harvestserver.noSets.why.header=What is a Harvesting Server?
harvestserver.noSets.why.reason1=Harvesting is a process of exchanging metadata with other repositories. As a harvesting <b><i>server</i></b>, your Dataverse can make some of the local dataset metadata available to remote harvesting clients. These can be other Dataverse instances, or any other clients that support OAI-PMH harvesting protocol. 
harvestserver.noSets.why.reason2=Only the published, unrestricted datasets in your Dataverse can be harvested. Remote clients normally keep their records in sync through scheduled incremental updates, daily or weekly, thus minimizing the load on your server. Note that it is only the metadata that are harvested. Remote harvesters will generally not attempt to download the data files themselves.

harvestserver.noSets.how.tip2=Once the service is enabled, you can define collections of local datasets that will be available to remote harvesters as <i>OAI Sets</i>.

Consult the Search API section of the Dataverse User Guide for more information on the search queries.
