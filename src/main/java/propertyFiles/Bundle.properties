harvestserver.noSets.why.header=What is a Harvesting Server?
harvestserver.noSets.why.reason1=Harvesting is a process of exchanging metadata with other repositories. As a harvesting <b><i>server</i></b>, your Dataverse can make some of the local dataset metadata available to remote harvesting clients. These can be other Dataverse instances, or any other clients that support OAI-PMH harvesting protocol. 
harvestserver.noSets.why.reason2=Only the published, unrestricted datasets in your Dataverse can be harvested. Remote clients normally keep their records in sync through scheduled incremental updates, daily or weekly, thus minimizing the load on your server. Note that it is only the metadata that are harvested. Remote harvesters will generally not attempt to download the data files themselves. 
harvestserver.noSets.how.header=How to run a Harvesting Server?
harvestserver.noSets.how.tip1=Harvesting server can be enabled or disabled on this page. 
harvestserver.noSets.how.tip2=Once the service is enabled, you can define collections of local datasets that will be available to remote harvesters as <i>OAI Sets</i>. Sets are defined by search queries (for example, authorName:king; or parentId:1234 - to select all the datasets that belong to the dataverse specified; or dsPersistentId:"doi:1234/" to select all the datasets with the persistent identifier authority specified). Consult the Search API section of the Dataverse User Guide for more information on the search queries.  
harvestserver.noSets.getStarted=To get started, enable the OAI server and click on the Add Set button. To learn more about Harvesting, visit the <a href="{0}/{1}/user/index.html#index" title="Harvesting - Dataverse User Guide" target="_blank">Harvesting</a> section of the User Guide.
