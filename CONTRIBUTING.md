## Bug Reports/Issues

An issue is a bug (a feature is no longer behaving the way it should) or a feature (something new to Dataverse that helps users complete tasks). You can browse the Dataverse [issue tracker] on GitHub by open or closed issues or by milestones.

[issue tracker]: https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues

Before submitting an issue, please search the existing issues by using the search bar at the top of the page. If there is an existing issue that matches the issue you want to report, please add a comment to it.

If there is no pre-existing issue, please click on the "New Issue" button, log in, and write in what the issue is. Someone on the Dataverse development team will appropriately tag and assign it to a member of the Dataverse development team.
